XviD4PSP 5.0.37.8 r132->r172 24.09.10, main changes:

>>> (r172) Various changes in WPF Video Player (WPF_VideoPlayer.exe), also source code added to SVN.
>>> (r171) Added another player engine: PictureView. In this mode preview shows a static picture of current frame; AviSynth
           is only loaded when preview is updating; better accuracy of frame counter.
>>> (r171) DVDImport window: fixed incorrect positioning of DirectShow preview, if system DPI not equal to 96; selected
           video renderer in Settings->Player engine->DirectShow output - now also used for DirectShow preview in this window.
>>> (r170) Fixed problems with copying text to clipboard.
>>> (r169) Added warning message, if Test script is used when audio/video track is in Copy mode.
>>> (r168) Added BlackmanResize.
>>> (r168) Some new deinterlacers has been added: QTGMC (Bob), YadifModEDI2 (Bob), TIVTC+TDeintEDI, TIVTC+YadifModEDI,
           TFM (field-matcher for videos with phase-shifted fields) and TDecimate 23-25 (for auto deleting duplicate frames).
>>> (r167) Fixed possible crash of DirectShow preview (if the script contains no video, or in some other cases).
>>> (r166) It is now possible to enter time position into "Set Start" & "Set End" fields (format is HH:MM:SS.ms), fixed possible crash.
>>> (r165) For option "Read parameters from the script when saving a new task" added fps detection, fixed possible crash.
>>> (r165) Output file size 0Mb instead of "Unknown", if format is Audio and encoding with VBR - fixed.
>>> (r164) Better friends-files searching ("Auto join" option) for vobs from one DVD (rep. by mihanja80).
>>> (r163) Fixed crash in AviSynthEncoder if creating encoder process (run a binary file) fails (rep. by Zag30).
>>> (r162) Better error handling for xvid_encraw.exe; encoding statistics from XviD now available in the encoding log.
>>> (r162) Next options has been added into XviD settings window: full1pass, threads, max_key_interval, bquant_ratio, bquant_offset,
           reaction, averaging, smoother, kboost, ostrength, oimprove, odegrade, chigh, clow, imin, imax, pmin, pmax, bmin, bmax,
           vbvmax, vbvsize, vbvpeak.
>>> (r161) From now, filtering part of the script (i.e. all text that placed between ###[FILTERING]### tags) will be untouched
           when script is re-created.
>>> (r160) If setting "Auto volume" = "Before encoding" and in queue few tasks based on one source-file, gain will
           be altered only for the first task - fixed.
>>> (r159) When XviD4PSP minimized or hidden, every new encoder window appears not in hidden-mode (rep. by brunorex).
>>> (r159) A new item "Disable balloons" added to TrayIcon menu (req. by brunorex).
>>> (r158) For Custom-format added ability to create THM-preview while encoding.
>>> (r157) Added ability to encode audio before encoding video. "Settings->Global settings->Encoding->Encode audio first,
           then video", disabled by default (video will be encoded first). This option may be very useful for "2-Pass size"
           and "3-Pass size" encodings with VBR audio, because when video encoding starts, exact size of the audio-file will
           be already known (by Procrustean).
>>> (r156) In Custom-format option Muxer=Disabled not worked properly, if video coder is XviD.
>>> (r153) Resolution/Aspect->Manual, after clearing SAR field, SAR receives wrong value ("" instead of null).
>>> (r152) For DirectShow player engine added ability to select video renderer (Settings->Player engine->DirectShow output).
>>> (r152) Fixed problem with preview (black borders and wrong AR) for anamorphic resolutions, if system video renderer uses
           option "Maintain Aspect Ratio" by default (rep. by AkvenJan).
>>> (r151) Custom format and formats settings window was reworked. Some options has been added:
           -mod for each side - as separate setting for this format.
           -Can be anamorphic - if it enabled, video will have anamorphic aspect when source-file is anamorphic (in
            global settings option "Maintain anamorphic aspect" must be enabled too). If it disabled, resolution
            will be recalculated to non-anamorphic.
           -Force format - muxers MP4Box and FFmpeg have special keys to override (force) output format. For FFmpeg
            you can set any format as you want (by editing ini-file).
           -Split output file - for muxers MKVMerge, MP4Box and tsMuxeR you can specify size of parts to split
            final file (you can set any size as you want by editing ini-file).
           -Don`t multiplex video and audio - do encode video and audio tracks, but don`t multiplex them in final file.
           -Use direct remuxing if possible - don`t demux tracks for Copy, instead use source-file and specify track
            that muxer must use from it, if possible.
>>> (r151) File extension wasn`t updated when changing Format (editing tasks in queue).
>>> (r150) Removed ConvertToYUY2() from the "preview"-script.
>>> (r149) FFmpeg as demuxer for MKV, if it contains VC-1 or WMV video.
>>> (r148) Fixed: bits/pixel calculation, prediction of output file size if Audio = Copy, audio-bitrate is unknown,
           but audio-file is already demuxed (rep. by NasaCNN).
>>> (r147) Fixed wrong duration and frames count if source file is RAW-AAC (*.aac).
>>> (r146) Added ability to preserve audio-delay in Copy mode (only for next muxers: MKVMerge, MP4Box, VirtualDubMod,
           FFmpeg, tsMuxeR). Due to some specific reasons this function may work improperly. Audio->Decoding->
           Apply Delay in Copy mode, disabled by default.
>>> (r146) Added a new method of audio-delay calculation. Most probably you need to use this method if video decoder is:
           FFmpegSource (1 or 2), DirectShowSource2, or DirectShowSource with "Enable Audio" is disabled. Audio->Decoding->
           Use new Delay calculation method, disabled by default.
>>> (r146) For DirectShowSource and FFmpegSource added option "Enable Audio", that allows this decoders to decode audio
           directly from the source file, w/o demuxing. If it`s disabled, audio will be extracted and decoded by regular
           audio-decoder.
>>> (r146) Option "Don`t demux audio for preview" has been removed.
>>> (r144) Out aspect 16:9 is now allowed for "AVI DV NTSC" and "AVI DV PAL" formats.
>>> (r144) Fixed a bug with incorrect resolution if SourceType = Decimating and Deinterlace = Disabled (bug since r117).
>>> (r143) Option "Don`t demux audio for preview" has been moved to the Audio-decoders settings window.
>>> (r143) Added: RawSource for y4m- and yuv-files; RaWavSource for wav-files, selected by default (req. by Procrustean).
>>> (r143) Added Film-percents analyser for DGIndex-files (Auto ForceFilm), enabled by default.
>>> (r143) Added settings window for audio- and video- decoders (Video->Decoding, Audio->Decoding).
>>> (r142) Fixed incorrect Temp path (http://forum.winnydows.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1433).
>>> (r141) "Save all scripts" added to tasks area context menu (req. by newsky).
>>> (r141) Save SAR to (and restore it from) the scripts - added (for anamorphic encoding).
>>> (r140) System tray icon now can be disabled (Settings->Global settings->Enable system tray icon).
>>> (r139) Some other fixes.
>>> (r139) Fixed fps detection with FFmpeg.
>>> (r139) Some caches remain in the Temp-folder if source file wasn`t opened successfully.
>>> (r139) Throw an Error if video decoder returns zero-size image.
>>> (r138) Added TrayIcon and added ability to minimize program to tray (req. by AkvenJan).
>>> (r137) Fixed blocking of folder with source file(s) ("drag-and-drop" opening).
>>> (r136) Added ability to reorder (move up/down) saved tasks (req. by mbamg).
>>> (r135) Some improvements for THM-creation and JPG-screenshots (by Procrustean).
>>> (r134) Resolution/Aspect window: added a new tab "Manual" (it allows user to specify all values manually).
>>> (r133) Added switcher to select preview mode (Preview/ScriptView). In the ScriptView-mode AviSynth is not loaded, as result
           very fast switching between filtering presets, formats, and in all other cases where preview must be loaded/updated;
           more capability with CUDA-decoders. This switcher available in the "Settings->Player engine" menu, and also in the
           player context menu (right-clik on the player area). (Idea by Procrustean).

Updated:   Package of plugins and filtering presets by Tempter57.
---
>>> (r132) Updated Spanish translation (by Tuko).
>>> (r131) x264.exe settings window: added Superfast preset (x264 r1510+); added --qpmax, --qpstep, --min-keyint, --keyint, --nal-hrd,
           --aud; some other changes.
>>> (r130) Added list of "Recent files".
>>> (r129) For the iPod 5.5G format with x264 encoding, a muxer was changed from the MP4Box(NicMP4Box) to ffmpeg (rep. by jhonny2).
>>> (r128) Updated Spanish translation (by Ginger).
>>> (r127) Added support for the DGMultiSource() decoder and dgi-files (DGIndexNV index files). The source file
           must be indexed by the DGIndexNV and project must be saved into separate folder (w/o any files in it).
           Then log-file must be placed in the same folder. If it wasn`t found, then all info will be recieved from
           the source-file via MediaInfo (but log file is more recommended).
           Some changes for the d2v and dga opening. For dga-files there is no need to put log-file in the same folder,
           but it`s still recommended.
>>> (r126) Audio gain detection is now fully internal, normalize.exe and temporal WAV-file is not needed anymore.
>>> (r125) Some fixes for FFV1 and HUFF encoders.
>>> (r124) Fixed problems with audio encoding for several tasks, when all this tasks is based on one source-file.
           Fixed problems with common audio encoding settings for all the tasks, if audio preset is Custom.
>>> (r123) In the x264 encoder window was updated internal presets, so now they fully equivalent to the same presets 
           from the x264.exe (Ultrafast, Veryfast, Faster, Fast, Medium, Slow, Slower, Veryslow, Placebo). B-pyramid mode
           is now Normal by default (x264 r1455+).
>>> (r122) In the AC3-encoder settings window added two new options: "Bandwidth" and "Dialog normalization level".
>>> (r121) Fixed issue with re-opening some DVDs (bug since r89).
>>> (r120) Removed option "Renew script when audio/video encoding settings is changed". For audio-settings the script will be auto 
           re-created if audio encoder was changed (but not their settings), for video-settings.. there is no any reasons to re-create
           script.
>>> (r119) Added new option "Don`t delete any caches and temp files" - for those who use XviD4PSP as script creator and then encoding
           it in another apps.
>>> (r118) Fixed some problems with audio-presets switcher (Disable mode on\off, switching between formats when source have no
           audio). Audio=Disabled now also can be used for Batch-opening (if "Clone audio options"- is on).
>>> (r117) Yadif is now default deinterlacer.
>>> (r117) "Smart" deinterlace for HYBRID_PROGRESSIVE_INTERLACED sources. If source type is HYBRID_PROGRESSIVE_INTERLACED, then 
           only frames with visible interlace will be deinterlaced. All other frames will be untouched. It works only for deinterlacers,
           that didn`t change framerate. On some specific videos (noisy etc) may produce bad results. Not intended for sources that
           must be IVTC`ed.
>>> (r116) Fixed UpdateOutFrames issues: trim and test-script wasn`t take into account; for deinterlacers that 
           change the number of frames, not occurred recount number of frames if AssumeFPS - is selected in settings
           "Framerate modifier".           
>>> (r116) For Batch-opening added new options: clone deinterlace, clone output framerate, clone audio options.
>>> (r115) Extension for demuxed vc1 streams was changed from VC1 to AVI (rep. by hikaru1022).
>>> (r114) If Audio encoding mode is VBR, then output file size must be "Unknown".
>>> (r112) Added FLAC encoder (from FFmpeg), it available for Audio and MKV formats.
>>> (r111) Added Estonian translation (Estonian.txt by tudiludi).
>>> (r110) In the x264 settings window for CRF mode label "Quantizer: (Q)" replaced by "Quality: (CRF)".
>>> (r110) In the AAC settings window added option -2passperiod (only for 2pass mode).
>>> (r108) Various changes in the Decoder, Demuxer, Encoder and AviSynthEncoder (error handling based on ExitCode and other).
>>> (r108) Added 2-pass ABR mode for AAC encoding. It require a temporal WAV-file, that will be created when encoding
           starts.
>>> (r107) For the AVI, MKV, MP4, MOV and Custom formats added ability to specify a valid divider for the picture sides
           (mod16, mod8, etc). Video->Resolution/Aspect->Settings.

Updated:   FFmpegSource2 (2.13 r257_test, http://code.google.com/p/ffmpegsource)
Updated:   MediaInfo (0.7.27, http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net)
Updated:   FFmpeg (unofficial build r21221, http://ffmpeg.org, http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/autobuilds)
Updated:   MKVtoolnix (3.0.0-build20100111-207, http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/win32/pre)
Updated:   neroAacEnc (1.5.1.0, http://www.nero.com/eng/downloads-nerodigital-nero-aac-codec.php)
---
>>> (r106) Fixed issue with loosing log from the x264.exe.
>>> (r105) Some fixes and changes in the Decoder.xaml.cs, Demuxer.xaml.cs, Caching.xaml.cs and MainWindow.xaml.cs.
           Opening files, demuxing streams..
>>> (r105) Option "Don`t demux audio for preview" now also work for FFmpegSource decoders. If it enabled, then files will
           be opened w/o audio demuxing, so audio will be decoded by FFmpegSource (but if it can`t decode, audio will be
           demuxed as usually). Remember that for many reasons it is not recommended to use this option!
>>> (r104) Added new option "Add AssumeFPS() to force FPS" for the FFmpegSource decoders (both). It must resolve problems
           with wrong fps sometimes received from this decoders, but it also can produce some new problems. This option is
           on by default and can be disabled in the Video->Decoding->FFmpegSource menu.
>>> (r103) Step for adjusting --qcomp now 0.01 (reg. by bugariarmando).
>>> (r103) Unneeded HotKey now can be disabled by right-clicking on it (reg. by Embox).
>>> (r102) Added encoding process priority "Above normal".
>>> (r102) Selected "Final action" now will be stored (rep. by Ghostlamer).
>>> (r101) NicMP4Box will be used if format = iPod 5.5G, video = x264 (or Copy) and NicMP4Box.exe exists here: \apps\MP4Box.
           This option already was implemented but can`t be used because 3-years old NicMP4Box didn`t know anything about
           the "-ipod" key, so there was error when muxing.
>>> (r100) Nothing special, simply rev. #100 :)
>>> (r99) A small changes in the "About" window.
>>> (r98) Custom CLI added and for the XviD too.
>>> (r97) Fixed problem with reset Custom CLI after storing it as preset (rep. by NewmanOZ).
>>> (r96) ListView instead of TextBox (HotKeys settings), desired action now can be choosen directly from the list.
---
>>> (r95) Fixed direct encoding to MKV if video coder other than x264 (it can be direct only if x264 is used, bug since r92).
          Also added direct encoding to MP4 and FLV, if video=x264 and audio=Disabled.
>>> (r95) Fixed bug with AVI encoding using x264 and disabled audio (rep. by electricway, bug since r58).
>>> (r94) Added enhanced HotKeys support, every hotkey can be redefined by user in the "Global settings->HotKeys" menu. 
          Simply select "Action", then press "Edit", then enter desired combination on the keyboard, and then press "Save".
>>> (r93) Added support for 64-bit x264.exe (via avs4x264.exe). To use it, you must add x264_64.exe and avs4x264.exe into
          x264 folder, and turn on this option it settings (Global settings->Encoding).
>>> (r92) Some changes in the MediaPlayerClassic call (now player is checked in 4 possible folders).
>>> (r92) Direct encoding (w/o intermediate files) to MKV if format=MKV, encoder=x264 and audio=Disabled.
>>> (r91) Fixed autogain with negative values ("-" was not used), expanded the range of adjustment.
>>> (r91) Added ability to disable auto delay insertion for the output audio track (Audio->Processing options).
>>> (r90) Batch opening: added ability to make a pause after 1-st opened file (for setup encoding settings), added ability
          to clone Aspect/Resolution settings from the already opened file to each other (will be copied mostly all settings
          from this window), and same thing added for the Trim. Settings->Global settings->Batch encoding.
>>> (r89) Some fixes for MPEG-opening (cache-folder deletion) and Fullscreen (preview positioning). 
>>> (r88) VisualCrop: some settings have been added to the Resolution/Aspect window on the Settings tab.
>>> (r87) VisualCrop: fixed possibility of crash if some problems with recieving or processing the picture is exist.
>>> (r86) MediaInfo provides rounded values, so for better precision now by default AR info will be recieved from the FFmpeg
          (it can be disabled in the Resolution/Aspect window on the Settings tab).
---
>>> (r83) Some changes in the Resolution/Aspect window; fixed possibility of crash when switching to fullscreen (r78).
>>> (r82-r85) Added "VisualCrop" (for manual cropping black borders).
>>> (r81) Restore Trim and Test-script from saved tasks.
---
>>> (r80) Added test-script (50x50 frames from the original video), menu AviSynth->Test script (reg. by crazy-cactus).
>>> (r79) Now before new file will start opening, previsious opened file will be closed first.
>>> (r79) If "Close file" is pressed, now  this file will be checked, is it still used in one of the saved tasks. If it 
          still used, then audio and video caches will be added to the list of files, that will be deleted when program
          is closing. Otherwise they will be deleted immediately.
>>> (r78) Main window now can be moved by mouse dragging.
>>> (r78) Now after leaving FullScreen will be restored previsious window state (like it was before FullScreen).
>>> (r78) FullScreen now also available by double clicking on the preview area (like in any regular players).
>>> (r76) All video restrictions from the ValidateCopyAudio moved to the ValidateCopyVideo.
>>> (r75, r77) Various code simplifications in the MainVindow (mostly by Embox).
>>> (r75) Fixed multiple calls of the MoveVideoWindow when entering/leaving Fullscreen mode (rep. by Embox).
>>> (r74) In the x264 settings window added Help-button (to show x264.exe --longhelp log).
>>> (r73) Fixed wrong SAR calculation for some resolutions and aspects (720x480@4:3 for example).

>>> (r66) In some cases select Temp-folder dialog is not appearing at the first start (reported by Embox).



-----------------------------------

XviD4PSP 5.0.37.5(Unofficial)->5.0.37.6(Unofficial) r65 20.11.09 Changelog:


>>> Option "Always close encoding window when finished" has been moved to the global setting.

>>> Now in the file name of the saved log will be added full name of the encoding file (with extension).
    -requested by crazy-cactus

>>> Fixed non-alignment of the audio track in Copy mode when encoding to MKV, if audio-file was not demuxed before
    encoding start (this may happen if decoder is DirectShowSource). 
    -reported by wwmax

>>> Now when you select the menu item "Reset all settings" will appear a confirmation dialog, and after reset settings
    the program will be restarted.
    -requested by Embox

>>> Now when you save the picture (frame) in the save dialog by default will be added name of the source file and current
    frame number. Added ability to save pictures as BMP.
    -requested by Embox

>>> The MediaInfo window was reworked: added drag-n-drop; added Save button (for saving resulting log into file); added 
    info-switcher (MediaInfo, MediaInfoFull, FFmpeg, MP4Box, mkvinfo) - now you can change source of the info, without
    closing the window.

>>> Option "Auto delete DGIndex cache" now works. Deletion will occurs when you close the file (if it`s not used in any 
    job) or when main window is closing. This option is disabled by default.
     -reported by Embox

>>> Added new option "Create DGIndex-cache in the temp folder". If you will use this option, you must avoid opening mpeg
    files with identical names, because for this files name of the folder for the cache will be the same. This option
    is disabled by default (cache file will be created in the same folder as the source file).

>>> For the FLV format was changed restrictions on the parameters of the audio file in the Copy-mode, added possibility
    to create FLV with x264-video and AAC-audio.

>>> For the muxers mkvmerge, ffmpeg and mp4box now when an error occurs while muxing, in the encoding log will be added
    message, recieved from this muxers. Added displaying of the CLI-arguments for the demuxers. Also was fixed bug with
    audio encoding (when encoding didn`t start but no errors in the log).
  
>>> Some changes in the media closing, which should help with the problem of crashes\hangs in the DVD-import and main
    windows. 

>>> When encoding with preservation anamorph, now after auto-crop width and height will be recalculated on following
    algorithm: (original resolution - cropped) rounded to the nearest acceptable resolution. 

>>> In the Custom-format added new option for limit number of audio-channels by two (2ch - max).

>>> Fixed crash when user change video decoder, but opened file - is audio. Also fixed possible crash, if the new 
    decoder is unable to open the current video file.
    -reported by Embox

>>> Enhanced batch opening files. Now, in addition to "Open Folder", in the main window you can drop multiple files,
    and after that will appears dialog of selecting the folder where to save them. After this all files will be opened
    and added into the queue. Same thing will happen if you select multiple files by clicking on "Open..". For all
    files opened in this way still will be used filter by extensions. 
    -multiple-file selection in the Open menu provides by the modified version of SafeOpenDialog (modified by Stressman).

>>> Some changes for the preview player. For the DirectShow engine significantly improved the accuracy of the frame-counter.
    Also should disappear problem when some files start playing for a shirt time imediately after opening. Increased
    the speed of loading preview after refreshing. For the MediaBridge engine also slightly improved accuracy of the
    frame-counter, but it still not enough.

>>> For the preview player was changed the way of positioning when moving the slider. Now positioning will be performed
    only when you release the mouse button, but not always while you move slider (like was before). In results - more
    faster navigation through the video. Old algorithm also still available, it can be selected in the menu "Settings->
    Player engine->Old seeking", or by clicking right mouse button on the slider (these two settings interconnected and
    merged).

>>> Due to some problems when opening files with multiple audio tracks, needing to re-create Avisynt-script before start 
    encoding (with losing all data entered/changed by user), as well as for the reason that audio anyway will be
    extracted, option "Don`t demux audio for preview" now will be off by default.

>>> Fixed problem with (not)copying the AAC-tracks. For the RAW-AAC files now, as it should be, extension will be aac. 
    For mkvmerge added option --aac-is-sbr, it will be added when you copy-AAC audio (except DirectRemux) desired value 
    is based on information from the MediaInfo.

>>> Some menu items now will be inactive, untill you does not open the file.

XviD4PSP 5.0.37.4(Unofficial)->5.0.37.5(Unofficial) r25 Changelog:

sorry for my bad english :D    

>>> Added posibility to save encoding log to file. It will be created in Temp-folder or in current working folder - depen-
    nding on settings. Also if you made double-click on text in encoding window, current contents of this window also
    will be saved as log-file (on this time file will be created in the current working folder, no matter what you choose
    in settings). And if an error has occur while encoding, log-file will be saved automaticaly (in Temp-folder, as
    error.log).

>>> Added batch encoding function (File->Open folder...). First you must select folder in which you stored the source
    files, then you must select destination folder, in which encoded files will be placed (it can be the same folder).
    To avoid opening all files in the folder, filter was introduced, that select only files wich specified file-
    extensions. You can edit valid extensions in Settings->Global settings->Batch encoding menu, also here you can choose,
    do you want to programm start encoding your files immediately after opening they all, or no. In case if destination
    file name is exist in selected folder, file name will be changed - full file name (with extension) of the source file
    will be added at the begining of the destination file name. After opening all files in the folder, you will see
    statistics window, and for the latest opened file will be loaded preview. If you want to open one more folder, you 
    can do it now. Known issues:
    --in the process of opening one of the file may occur an error, and programm may hang up or something else..
    --in the process of opening one of the file, a programm window may appear (for selecting audio track, or something).
    --after opening audio-file programm change encoding format to Audio, and all other files will be opened with this
      format. To avoid this you must: delete (or replace) all audio-files from your folder, or (better way) edit valid
      file-extensions in the Settings->Global settings->Batch encoding menu.
    --you can`t pre-specified some parameters for the encoding file, such as resolution, etc. You can only: select filt-
      ration, colorcorrection, video and audio codec settings, and encoding format (but you need to open one file first,
      to some of this settings became available). Also you can use auto-options, that working after opening file (auto-
      volume, auto-crop, auto-deinterlace).
    --may be the new Custom format will help with previous issue, if you will be able to configure it as you need :)

>>> Instead of old plugin nnedi.dll now will be used new nnedi2.dll (it`s used in YadifModEDI, MCBob and NNEDI deinterlace
    filters).

>>> Added test of the Temp folder, to check is there are some files in it, or it`s empty. This check will be run after
    you selecting a new Temp-folder in Settings, or when programm find another disc with more free-space, and you hit Yes.
    If Temp-folder is not empty, an error window will appear, that will propose to go into the folder to delete files, or
    ignore this message. But it`s strongly recommended that you delete all not needed files, especialy if they starts
    with 4 digits (like 0358.h264 or 1254.mp3). Also in Settings->Global settings->Temp files was added Open button
    (to open selected Temp-folder).

>>> Now from the filtering preset to current script will be replaced and empty lines too (that contains nothing; they are
    deleting before) - it must enhances readability of the script.
  
>>> Added --subme10, --no-mbtree, --rc-lookahead and --no-psy options (in the x264 settings window), encoding presets 
    also was updated (by Procrustean).

>>> Added very experimental Custom format. All settings for this format stored in the FormatSettings.ini file, and 
    you can change it manualy, or use for this purpose specially designed new window - Edit format. Maybe in the future
    some other formats also will be transferred from the programm to this ini-file.

>>> Little fix for the new MediaInfo: if it says that video have PullDown, and if it have 23.976fps, then in programm retu-
    rnes value 29.970 fps. This fix was needed because MPEG2Source, using PullDown flag, will play this video at the
    29.970 fps. In other way, w/o this fix XviD5PSP will thinking that video is realy have 23fps, and did`t start process
    of deinterlace-analysing. But after this fix Xvid4PSP will start this process, and then turn on TIVTC for this video.

>>> In Video->Decoding->MPEG files menu was added new item: ForceFilm for MPEG2Source (for DGIndex). If you enable this
    option, and if MediaInfo says that current video is PullDowned + have 23fps, then DGIndex will indexing current file
    with option ForcedFilm (read DGIndex manual before use it!). In other case this option will be ignored.

>>> In the Tools menu item WPF Video Player was replaced by Open XviD4PSP folder. It will open folder, where XviD4PSP is
    located (may help, if you want to edit or change some files by yourself).

>>> Now in the encoding log you will see all info, that x264 produce when encoding. All lines from this log have filtering
    before, and in some cases this results in loosing some log-info (some error messages didn`t showing).  

>>> Fixed number of audio-channels detection using ffmpeg.exe. It was broken due to some changes in ffmpeg info-log.

>>> In "forbidden to copy" was added files with extensions: .avs, .d2v(only for video stream) and .dga(only for video st-
    ream).

>>> Fixed crashing when you trying to open audio-encoding settings window but audio mode is Disabled.
    --Reported by Makkay

>>> For the FLV format added posibility to muxing video, encdoded with On2 VP6 (FV4) codec.

>>> Fixed wrong decoder selection for .ts and .m2ts files with h264, there was always selected DirectShowSource for this
    files. Now decoder will be choosen according to settings for Other Files (if .ts or .m2ts contains h264), or for MPEG
    files (if .ts or .m2ts contains MPEG).

>>> Fixed wrong interpretation of fps value, recieved from the x264 while encoding, that may appear on some machines. 
    --Reported by carbonize.

>>> Some other changes..

Seems that 5.036 was last official version of the XviD4PSP. Winnydows (developer of the XviD4PSP) says many times that project 
XviD4PSP was stopped, and instead of this program he making new one - Winnydows Commander (with also contains Multi-encoder 
feature). This version of XviD4PSP I made only for myself. It means that all changes that I made were necessary for me, for me
and only for me. But if this changes will also necessary for you - I will be very glad :)
I`m not a programmer, so please forgive me all new bugs! :D You will use this version at your own risk!!!
