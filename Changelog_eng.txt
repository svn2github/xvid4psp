XviD4PSP 5.10.345.0 (06.02.2015), main changes:


>>> (r345) x265: another few small changes for the recent builds.
>>> (r344) x265: fixed --cutree and --pbratio keys.
>>> (r343) x265: fixed Tune "Fast Decode" settings (they were from another preset by mistake).
>>> (r342) Encoder window: handling a child process when canceling encoding or changing encoding priority.
           It is only actual for x264\x265, running through avs4x26x. Previously, changing the priority
           worked only for avs4x26x and not for x264\x265. When cancelling the encoding, only avs4x26x was
           killed, but x264\x265 still continued their work for some time.
>>> (r341) Changed a little bit progress detection for x264, x264_enc_time's patched builds are also supported now.
>>> (r341) Added support for x265 (8\10bit, x86\64). Logo for settings window - george$t and AkvenJan.
>>> (r340) DVD-import window: changed IFO-based calculation of title's duration; switched back to VStrip.dll
           determination of resolution, AR and standard; added selection of playing vob and fullscreen mode.
>>> (r339) Help menu: web links updated.
>>> (r339) Changed progress detection for recent MP4Box, as the result removed support for old NicMP4Box.
           For "MP4 iPod 50G" and "MP4 iPod 55G" formats removed autoselection of the muxer, it can be
           chosen manually in the format settings window.
>>> (r339) QAAC: added "Delay signaling" (--gapless-mode) and "Compensate encoder delay" (--no-delay) options.
>>> (r338) LSMASHSource: auto detecting of high-bit output from it and specifying the nearest 8-bit format in
           this case.
>>> (r337) Format settings window: maximum resolution increased to 7680x4320, minimum mod for width decreased
           to 2. There is no changes in the formats itself.
>>> (r337) MKVMerge: the keys for audio\video tracks muxing moved to the default settings in the format settings
           window, added --disable-track-statistics-tags key. If these MKVMerge-muxing settings already has been
           changed, you need to Reset them now (in this window)!
>>> (r336) x264: added --aq-mode 3, --stitchable, and new items for "Color primaries, Transfer characteristics,
           Color matrix settings".
>>> (r335) Auto aborting of freezed tasks ("Settings->Global settings->Encoding"): it is now possible to adjust
           the time threshold.
>>> (r334) Fixed error handling for recent version of bassAudioSource.
>>> (r333) Added support for indexing files via DGIndexNV. In order to use it you must obtain your own licensed
           copy of DGDecNV package and put it into the \apps\DGDecNV folder, then select DGSource on the "Video->
           Decoding" tab. In the "Tools" menu DGPulldown replaced with DGIndexNV. Clicking on the "folder" icon
           at this item will open the folder \apps\DGDecNV. If not exist, it will be created first. Clicking on
           the item itself will run DGIndexNV.exe or open the website of the author of this utility (if the file
           does not exist). And here it is: http://rationalqm.us/dgdecnv/dgdecnv.html
>>> (r332) Reworked copying to the clipboard (Issue 79).
>>> (r331) "Tools->Open XviD4PSP folder" - was broken since r321, fixed now.
>>> (r331) DSS2: updates for LAVFilters 0.63.0. DXVA2 hardware decoding mode is now also choosable, and
           HEVC codec too (HEVC "hybrid" hw-acceleration is stated as experimental in LAVFilters 0.63.0).

>>> (r330) For LSMASHAudioSource changed the way how requested audio track number is calculated when decoding
           directly from the source file.
>>> (r329) Audio\Video decoding: added support for LSMASHVideoSource, LSMASHAudioSource, LWLibavVideoSource
           and LWLibavAudioSource (all 4 from the LSMASHSource.dll). LWLibav*Source - this is a multiformat
           decoder, it will index your file before opening (unfortunatelly, currently it is not possible to
           show the progress of this process). LSMASH*Source - only for MPEG-4 format (mp4, mov, 3gp), it
           will not indexing anything. To enable deletion of the index-files from the LWLibav*Source (*.lwi),
           which is disabled by default, go to the "Settings->Global settings->Temporal files" window.
>>> (r328) PictureView: audio and video playing threads will be created only when the play back is actually
           started, as they aren't needed before this point.
>>> (r327) Manual crop window: changed the way of getting and rendering the images. Added ability to change
           the color and transparency of the mask right in this window. From the "Resolution/Aspect->Settings->
           Manual crop" window removed some options, that doesn't requires there anymore, and added an option
           to "Open window in fullscreen mode" (to launch Manual crop in maximized state).
>>> (r326) Changed the defaults for muxing via MKVMerge (removed --compression -1:none key; added --engage
           no_cue_duration and --engage no_cue_relative_position keys). This defaults can be changed in the
           format settings window on the "Muxing" tab.
>>> (r325) Set variable XviD4PSPPluginsPath = "path" when loading filtering presets.
>>> (r324) MediaInfo window: added MediaInfo.dll version info.
>>> (r323) "File->Recent files" - their count now can be adjusted from 1 to 30 in the same menu.
>>> (r322) In addition to r321 it is now also possible to specify a custom tools via apps\Custom\Tools.ini.
           Every line, that starts not with the "#" symbol, will be treated as a valid path. This path can
           be relative or absolute and lead to a file or to a folder.
>>> (r321) The content of subfolders in the apps\Custom folder (only *.exe, *.com, *.bat and *.cmd files)
           will be shown in "Tools" menu. Also it is now possible to open a tools folders from this menu.
>>> (r320) Added an option to check the location of the newly created windows on the screen. If a window not
           fit to the working area, it will be relocated to fit this area. If several monitors is installed,
           the working area of the one that contains the bigger part of the window will be used. If current
           location of the window doesn't belong to any available monitors, then the most nearest monitor will
           be used. This option is enabled by default and can be disabled in "Settings->Global settings->Fit
           windows to the working area bounds".
>>> (r319) PictureView: unload AviSynth right after loading the preview (if not in playing state) and when saving
           a task. The Play/Pause button will look like Stop button. AviSynth will be loaded again when needed.
>>> (r318) x264 10-bit: when output colorspace is I422, I444 or RGB, the key "--profile high10" must be removed
           from the CLI (rep. by Okocha1976).
>>> (r317) Fix for r316.
>>> (r316) DirectShowLib-2005.dll, MediaBridge.dll, SharpDX.dll and SharpDX.DirectSound.dll moved to dlls\Player.
>>> (r315) Some options, that can be applied to PictureView via AviSynth script (mostly for testing purposes):
           ShowPictureViewInfo=true - to output some info, it is related to audio in the first place.
           OPT_UseWaveExtensible=false - to switch audio description from WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE to WAVEFORMATEX.
           OPT_dwChannelMask=value(int) - to override the channels mask (layout) when using WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE.
>>> (r315) Added optional audio output via DirectSound (using SharpDX wrapper). It is disabled by default, but
           can be enabled in the "Settings->Player engine->PictureView output->Enable audio" menu. Note that there
           is absolutely no warranty that it will work (especially when outputing a multi-channel or multi-bit audio
           via obsolete sound cards and\or broken drivers). And the audio\video sync is also not guaranteed.
>>> (r314) PictureView: increased accuracy of framerate holding.
>>> (r313) If an error has occurred while loading the preview, it will no longer lead to closing current task.
>>> (r313) PictureView: if InteropBitmap can't be used (.NET Framework 3.0 without SP1), then WriteableBitmap will be
           used instead. It works less efficient, but at least it works.
>>> (r312) MediaBridge preview now maintain the AR.
>>> (r312) PictureView preview completely reworked. Added ability to play the video (without sound) and for slow sources
           it can be usefull to enable "Settings->Player engine->PictureView drop" to drop some frames while play back.
           But, AviSynth now will be loaded all the time till preview is opened. Also, due to using InteropBitmap, this
           preview will only work if .NET Framework 3.0 with SP1 is installed.
>>> (r311) Support for opening multiple files via command line.
>>> (r310) XviD4PSP and WPF Video Player: instead of OLE Drag&Drop now uses Win32 Drag&Drop, which works with UAC.
>>> (r309) Added ability to sort presets by last modification time ("Settings->Global settings->Sort presets
           by last modification time").
>>> (r309) The order of the presets (filtering, color correction, video and audio encoding, FFRebuilder)
           wasn't guaranteed (rep. by imgeorgest).
>>> (r308) Added a window for AviSynth MT settings (AviSynth->MT settings).
>>> (r307) DSS2: thread-safe'ing the code for loading the filters in "portable" mode.
>>> (r307) DSS2: changes for LAVFilters 0.55.1 (in XviD4PSP settings added allowed resolutions for hardware decoding).
>>> (r306) DSS2: waiting timeout for decoded frame was increased from 10 to 30 seconds, but it can be
           adjusted via "timeout" (int) key.
>>> (r306) DSS2: changed the way how the filters is loaded in "portable" mode (rep. by Alfa Romeo).
>>> (r305) Encoder, Decoder, Demuxer, Indexing_FFMS and FFInfo windows: improved performance of logging (utilities output).
>>> (r304) Added support for x262.exe. But this encoder is highly experimental, use it at your own risk!
           Thanks to AkvenJan for the logo.
>>> (r303) "FramerateDetector" window - removed.
>>> (r302) DSS2: added cropping of 1 pixel if pixel format requires that the side of the image must be mod2.
>>> (r301) "Decoding" window: added few new options for DirectShowSource2; added 2 tabs with some LAV Filters settings;
           by default DSS2 will use LAV Filters (LAV Splitter and LAV Video Decoder) in portable mode, instead of using
           your system DirectShow filters.
>>> (r295-r301) Various changes in DSS2: added advanced error messages; fixed hangs when processing the last frames;
           Haali Video Sink - is now internal part of the plugin, so Haali Media Splitter is not required anymore;
           improved behavior when it's not possible to decode requested frame; added few new settings; added ability
           to load subtitles (but only the first stream will be processed); added ability to load LAV Filters directly
           from theirs .ax-files, with custom settings (i.e. in portable mode); when LAV Video Decoder is used, all the
           filters in the Graph will be connected using ConnectDirect method - it's excludes the possibility of some
           unwanted filters will be auto-inserted in the Graph.
>>> (r294) Added source code for DSS2.
>>> (r294) Reverted encoding progress detection for x264 r2208+.
>>> (r293) Encoding progress detection for x264 r2204+.
>>> (r292) Fix for error message from RaWavSource (NicAudio): "m2RaWavSource: unsupported number of channels defined".
>>> (r291) AutoCrop: transmit calculated values using script global variables (instead of creating a
           temporal file).
>>> (r290) ScriptRunner ("Run script"): improved performance by removing unnecessary colorspace conversion;
           added displaying of elapsed time and average fps; automatic closing the window when running is
           finished - is now an option, that can be disabled.
>>> (r289) Fixed deletion of encoded files when output path is Temp-folder and the muxing stage
           isn't required (rep. by D.Y).
>>> (r288) Added advanced tooltips for filtering presets. But, since they are written on Russian and not
           translated to other languages, this option is disabled by default if selected language is not Russian.
           Can be enabled in "Settings->Global settings->Misc->Show advanced tooltips for filtering presets".
>>> (r287) "Global settings->Encoding" window: an option "Use 64-bit x264" has changed it's meaning and name
           for 32-bit OS users. Like previously, this option allows to launch x264 via avs4x264, but
           instead of x264_64.exe (which is a 64-bit version of the encoder) on a 32-bit OS will be launched
           x264.exe (which is a regular 32-bit version). So the encoding will be splitted onto two processes
           (AviSynth + avs4x264 - the first one, x264 - the second one), and it may help to eliminate the
           limitation of ~2Gb available memory per process on this OS.
>>> (r287) Added auto detection of the "OUTPUT_BIT_DEPTH = xx" label in the script. When encoding using
           x264 and xx not equal to 8, x264 (or x264_64, if OS is 64-bit) will be launched via avs4x264 and
           the value of xx will be added to the command line with "--input-depth xx" key. It allows to simplify
           Hi10P encoding using appropriate filtering presets, that outputs a "hacked" high-bit-depth video.
>>> (r286) "Color correction" window: added "Full range" and "Dithering" options. For "Dithering"
           AviSynth 2.6+ is required.
>>> (r285) Fixed possible NullReferenceException in the "Message" window (bug since r269).
>>> (r285) Various changes in AviSynthWrapper.dll. Changed the way to retrieve the AviSynth version.
>>> (r284) In the project files added a bat-patcher for setting the LARGEADDRESSAWARE flag. It will increase the
           maximum amount of memory available for the program when running on 64-bit OS or on appropriately
           configured 32-bit OS (thanks to shark000X for the info).
>>> (r283) "Resolution/Aspect" window: checkbox for the option "Recalculate aspect when crop is using" replaced with
           combobox. Now it is possible to choose between: Nothing, Aspect, Everything. With the last one all values
           will be recalculated in the same way as for the autocrop (req. by XACAH18).
>>> (r282) The results of the interlace detection, that appears in tooltip for the Analyse button, now will
           be stored. Also added some info about interlacement from MediaInfo (available not in all cases).
>>> (r281) Updated the year and _READ_THIS_.txt.
>>> (r280) Added support for qaac.exe - an AAC\ALAC encoder that uses QuickTime (Apple) API. QuickTime, iTunes or
           Safari must be installed in order to make it possible to use qaac. Or you can extract AppleApplicationSupport.msi
           from theirs installers and install only this package, since this is the only one and only component that is
           required for qaac. Additionally you can avoid to install anything at all, simply copy required dlls from
           AppleApplicationSupport.msi to the same folder with qaac.exe (or to subfolder qaac\QTFiles - this is also
           allowed). Or ask Google for "qaac.exe portable". https://sites.google.com/site/qaacpage/ - qaac.exe site.
           Thanks to AuronSV (wayger) for the initial start of this revision and for the logo.
>>> (r279) x264 settings window: added Level 5.2, in\out range, lookahead threads (r2200+).
>>> (r278) Added filtering of MediaInfo information to avoid getting double-values (rep. by brunorex).
>>> (r278) "Media Info" window: fixed stdout buffer overflow for mkvinfo.exe and MP4Box.exe.
>>> (r277) "Resolution/Aspect" window: swap comboboxes for flipping vertical/horizontal.
>>> (r277) MKVToolnix: changed the way to retrieving tracks IDs for (de)muxing (v5.2.1+); changed the way how
           audio delay must be handled when copying from MP4\MOV (v5.3.0+).
>>> (r276) Added support for opening a grf-files (see http://avisynth.org/mediawiki/DirectShowSource#Opening_GRF_files
           and http://avisynth.org/mediawiki/Importing_media - "1.5 How do I use GraphEdit" item). If file name starts
           with the "audio" prefix, this file will be opened as an audio graph, otherwise it will be opened as a video graph.
           For the video graphs you can also add a key "fps=xxx" - this value will be passed to the DirectShowSource().
           And if the folder contains another grf-file with a similar name, but starts with the "audio" prefix (for example:
           "my_file fps=25.000.grf" and "audio my_file.grf") - this file will be loaded too. Or you can load it manually
           (add a file as an external track), in this case there is no requirement for the "audio" prefix.
>>> (r275) "Resolution/Aspect" window: added ability to flip vertical/horizontal.
>>> (r275) Fixed(?) aspect adjusting method "Black" (incorrect calculation of horizontal black borders for anamorphic
           encoding).
>>> (r274) Advanced time parsing for "GoTo" and "SetStart"/"SetEnd" fields. In addition to the standard form
           (HH:MM:SS.ms), now you can also use another form: ####x, where #### - is a digit(s) (fractional values
           also allowed) and x - h(ours), or m(inutes), or s(econds), or ms(milliseconds). All of this will be
           valid: 1.25h | 1H 20m | 10.5m | 0.2h 30M 500,1s | ,5H .5M | 15000ms | 2000,55S and so on.
>>> (r273) In the menu "AviSynth" added an option for sequential reading all the frames from the script ("Run script").
           For example, it may be used to perform a 1-st pass of a 2-pass mode vfr-conversion using TDecimate. Or for
           something similar, that requires the script to be runned to get the result(s).
>>> (r272) Unlocked (and fixed) the code for determining the muxing progress when VirtualDubMod is used.
>>> (r272) Changed the stdout encoding for MKVMerge (MKVInfo and MKVExtract) to UTF-8; removed "MKVRebuilder" window.
>>> (r272) "Maintain anamorphic aspect" and "Always encode to progressive video" was removed from the "Global settings"
           window, and from the "Resolution/Aspect->Settings" window was removed an option "Allow resolutions divisible by" - 
           all of this is individual format settings from now.
>>> (r272) Custom-format settings window is now available for other (mostly all) formats. A few new options was added.
>>> (r271) Removed a warning for DirectShowSource2 about unacceptability of non-Latin characters in
           the pathes (an updated version of avss.dll does not suffer from this bug anymore).
>>> (r270) Added ability to enter a time in frame counter (req. by Koks).
>>> (r269) Message window and Shutdown window: fixed a possible error on specifying the Owner (rep. by Czavidvilal).
>>> (r268) Remove audio from the VisualCrop (Manual crop) scripts (like in r246).
>>> (r267) x264 encoding: instead of reading fps values from the x264 log, use internal fps calculation
           after pausing the encoding. Internal fps calculation is less precise and will be used only because
           x264 fps calculation is based on the time, elapsed from the start of the encoder, so after pausing
           this values isn't correct.
>>> (r266) FFInfo: fixed a potential stderr buffer overflow.
>>> (r265) MediaInfo: changed the column size for MediaInfo log. In previous versions of MediaInfo the size was
           32, in current versions the size is 40. XviD4PSP will customize this value to 35 (it can be changed in
           the registry: HKCU\Software\Winnydows\XviD4PSP5, the key MI_ColumnSize - is for XviD4PSP and the key
           WPFPlayer_MI_ColumnSize - is for WPF_VideoPlayer).
>>> (r264) x264 settings window: added "I422" to "Output colorspace" combobox (x264 r2081+).
>>> (r263) If there is no file opened, the "Filtering" window now can be used to edit the filtering presets.
>>> (r262) Reworked the way how XviD4PSP interact with AvsP. Removed blocking of XviD4PSP when AvsP is running,
           because this blocking also blocks the encoding progress determination, so after 10 minutes current
           encoding will be aborted as "freezed" (rep. by LonerD).
>>> (r261) Fixed the reaction on pressing the Delete key when the tasks list is focused (bug since r94).
>>> (r260) Tooltip`s the "time of a life" prolonged for mostly all user controls.
>>> (r260) Added ability to auto select the audio track during the opening of the file (based on its
           language or ordinal number). "Audio->Decoding->Track selection", disabled by default (req. by Tyler).
>>> (r259) x264 settings window: highlighting as "inactive" for some user controls instead of changing
           theirs opacity (that was added in r245).
>>> (r258) Fixed FOURCC for HUFF.
>>> (r257) Settings for TDeint was changed (req. by Tempter57).
>>> (r257) Added QTGMC without doubling the framerate (req. by buffometer).
>>> (r257) Combobox "Framerate converter" ("Interlace/Framerate" window) now will be highlighted as "inactive",
           if framerate converter isn`t active.
>>> (r256) Added some warnings for DirectShowSource2 (it may hang when processing the last frames) and for
           FFmpegSource2 (interlaced H.264 may be decoded not as it should\expected).
>>> (r255) Some changes related to determination of encoding speed and estimated time.
>>> (r255) Added an option to abort encoding if there is no progress for more than 10 minutes, it`s enabled by default
           and can be disabled in "Settings->Global settings->Encoding->Cancel encoding if there is no progress
           for a long time" (req. by LonerD).
>>> (r254) For MediaBridge-preview was increased the accuracy of the frame counter.
>>> (r254) For DirectShow-preview added ability to use EVR for the output ("Settings->Player engine->DirectShow output").
>>> (r253) WPF Video Player: Added support for Windows 7 taskbar progress indication (enabled by default for Windows 7);
           added a catcher for unhandled exceptions.
>>> (r252) For MediaInfo window added checkbox "Wrap text".
>>> (r252) WPF Video Player: for DS-filters that used in the Graph added ability to show their PropertyPage; added
           a MediaInfo window.
>>> (r251) WPF Video Player: EVR (Enhanced Video Renderer) now can be choosen as DirectShow output;
           some other changes.
>>> (r250) Manual crop: added "Autocrop on current frame" and "Remove crop" buttons; added support for global HotKeys
           for preview (xxx frames\min.\sec. backward\forward and Fullscreen); AviSynth now is not unloaded after
           recieving the frame, it keeps loaded untill the window will be closed (for more faster navigation on the
           video); for error messages added StackTrace information and current AviSynth script.
>>> (r250) Auto crop: added progress determination; added an option "Crop using the most common values" ("Resolution/
           Aspect->Settings", disabled by default) which is switching the autocrop from cropping using a minimum values
           to cropping using the most common values for all the frames that`s being analyzed.
>>> (r249) Added a few new hotkeys: Ctrl+Up/Down - 100 frames forward/backward; Shift+Right/Left - 30 sec.
           forward/backward; Shift+Up/Down - 3 min. forward/backward (req. by BBDragon).
>>> (r248) Normalizer: for error messages added StackTrace info and current AviSynth script.
>>> (r247) Auto crop: for error messages added StackTrace info and current AviSynth script.
>>> (r246) The scripts for source detector and for autocrop must be without audio (rep. by Brainel).
>>> (r246) Source detector: for error messages added StackTrace info and current AviSynth script.
>>> (r245) x264: added --tune option; added --subme 11 mode (x264 r2036+); all the tooltips now will show the "raw"
           defaults of the encoder (without --profile and --tune affection); some other changes.
>>> (r244) Audio\Video encoders settings windows and "Color correction" window is now accessible even if there is no
           input file opened.
>>> (r243) "Aspect/Resolution" and "Interlace/Framerate" windows is now accessible even if there is no input file
           opened. But in this case only the "Settings" tab will be active.
>>> (r242) "Aspect/Resolution" window: on the "Settings" tab added an option "Use the original AR of the stream",
           which is enabled by default. It works the same way as "Use the original fps of the stream" does, but
           instead of framerate it affects the AR. "Input aspect" and "Output aspect" comboboxes is editable now
           (the 2nd one - only if selected format allows non-fixed aspects).
>>> (r241) "Interlace/Framerate" window: on the "Settings" tab added an options "Use the original fps of the stream" and
           "Allow non-standard fps on output". If the first one is checked, then "Original frame rate" field from
           the MediaInfo log will be used to determine the framerate of the input file (this field contains fps of
           the raw video stream if it doesn`t match fps of the container). The second option is only works with AVI,
           MP4, MOV, MKV and Custom formats. If checked, all non-standard fps will be passed on output without rounding
           to the nearest standard value. For these formats it`s now also possible to enter any arbitrary fps into
           "Output framerate" combobox.
>>> (r240) x264: added an --output-csp option (r2019+); added High10 AVC Profile, which is used as a switcher between
           8-bit depth and 10-bit depth versions of x264 (the latter one must be placed into \apps\x264_10b folder).
>>> (r239) By default the number of decoding threads for FFmpegSource2 is set to 1, i.e. multithreaded decoding
           is disabled (because of possible instability).
>>> (r238) Added ability to specify the number of decoding threads for FFmpegSource2 (Video->Decoding).
>>> (r237) HotKeys: enabled HotKeys for MainWindow when "OwnedWindows.Count > 0"; fixed menu navigation with keyboard.
>>> (r235-r236) Some noncritical fixes.
>>> (r235) Shift + Exit = kill the process of XviD4PSP instead of normal closing.
>>> (r234) x264: according to r1935 the --open-gop key was changed and the --bluray-compat key was added (Misc tab).
>>> (r233) "Interlace/Framerate": added settings for QTGMC (Preset, Sharpness) and IsCombedTIVTC (#, CThresh, MI).
           Framerate converter MSUFrameRate was replaced by ConvertMFlowFPS (based on functions MAnalyse and MFlowFps
           from the MVTools2 plugin, can be tuned by editing the VideoFunctions.avs file).
>>> (r232) For "MP4 PS3 or XBOX360" AC3 audio is now allowed in Copy mode (req. by Tyler).
>>> (r231) In the Message window added context menu "Copy" (to clipboard).
>>> (r230) Caching: do not analyze any errors that was produced by external AviSynth-scripts (rep. by Ghostlamer).
>>> (r229) MPEG2Source: fixed incorrect handling of Force Film on files reopening (rep. by LonerD).
>>> (r228) Small changes for the QTGMC3.31.
>>> (r227) Remove "-IA=6" from the DGIndex command line (rep. by agz).
>>> (r226) StackTrace info in error messages for Informer and MediaInfo windows.
>>> (r225) Fixed a possible crash on button Encode click (rep. by DAlek01).
>>> (r224) Added resizers: SplineResize, Spline100Resize and Spline144Resize (all 3 powered by SplineResize.dll).
>>> (r222) Various changes for Caching window. For error messages added StackTrace info and current
           AviSynth script.
>>> (r222) Some fixes for "Join file" function. But still, it doesn`t work as good as it should..
>>> (r222) DirectShowSource2 (DSS2): added a workaround, that may help with hanging on the last frame(s).
           From now, the last 3 frames, instead of receiving them from the decoder, will be duplicated from
           the previous (4-th from the end) frame. This behavior can be tweaked by editing the VideoFunctions.avs.
>>> (r222) NicAC3Source and NicDTSSource: added DRC checkboxes (by default DRC is disabled).
>>> (r222) A new options was added for FFmpegSource2: "Overwrite existing index files" - always re-index
           the source file and overwrite existing index file, even if it was valid; disabled by default.
           "Timecodes" - extract timecodes to a file during indexing (this file will be placed in the same
           folder with the index file); disabled by default. "Create FFmpegSource2 cache in Temp folder" -
           if enabled (or if the source file is on the Read Only drive), index file will be created in Temp
           folder, otherwise it will be created near the source file; enabled by default.
>>> (r222) FFmpegSource1 was completely removed. For FFmpegSource2 indexing now will be performed using
           ffmsindex.exe, this makes it possible to show progress indication and also to safely cancel this
           operation.
>>> (r222) The following decoders now also can be choosen: QTInput (for videos encoded with ProRes; QuickTime
           is required!), DirectShowSource (as audio decoder), FFAudioSource.
>>> (r222) Changed the way to choose video and audio decoders. From now, the user can add their own or edit existing
           extensions and select appropriated decoder for every extension. But be careful! Before switching
           to one or another decoder, take a look at the "Supported formats" in the tooltips, because not all
           decoders are multiformat decoders, so, for example, attempting to use MPEG2Source for an MKV files
           will results in error on file opening. "Reset" button - to reset extensions/decoders list to default values.
           "Delete" button - to delete current (highlighted) line, you can delete all lines, except "mpeg_ps/ts" and "*"
           ("MPEG-files" and "Other files" accordingly). "Add" button - to add a new line to the list.
>>> (r221) FFInfo: fixes for recent versions of FFmpeg.
>>> (r220) Various changes for DVDImport, IndexChecker and Indexing windows (added StackTrace info
           for error messages; added Windows 7 taskbar progress indication when indexing).
>>> (r220) Fixed incorrect detection of the DVD`s titles duration.
>>> (r220) Indexing (DGIndex): a few fixes related to max. path length exceeding (rep. by Mirex).
>>> (r219) Trim: added ability to specify more than one region.
>>> (r218) x264: --qpmax and --qp - changed default/maximum values.
>>> (r217) Added check for AviSynth on start-up.
>>> (r217) Print more info about the System in the encoding log (req. by Procrustean).
>>> (r216) Small changes for the QTGMC3.0.
>>> (r215) NumericUpDown: set IsAction=false when value out of limits.
>>> (r214) XviD settings window: fixed detection of custom-matrix from the encoding preset (rep. by brusya).
>>> (r214) XviD settings window: added ability to redefine quantizer for the 1-st pass of multi-passes
           encoding, "Misc->1-st pass Quantizer" (req. by Tempter57).
>>> (r214) XviD settings window: added options VHQ metric (-metric, only for 1.3.0) and Chroma optimizer.
>>> (r214) XviD: version 1.2.2 now will be used for encoding by default, again. You can switch to version
           1.3.0 in "Misc->Use new XviD 1.3.0".
>>> (r213) Fixed invalid deletion of DGIndex caches if option "Auto delete DGIndex cache" is enabled, but index
           folder was created by user. Now index folder will NOT be deleted if user opened a *.d2v file in the
           XviD4PSP; folder will be deleted only if the path ends with ".index"; subfolders will not be deleted
           (rep. by Лидка, bug since r32).
>>> (r212) The NumericUpDown user control must receive focus on pressing the up (+) or down (-) buttons (bug since r195).
>>> (r211) Lame MP3 settings window: fixed some bugs with command line re-creation; added mode "Auto" for 
           "Channels mode", selected by default; added combobox for Replay Gain (rep./req. by Procrustean).
>>> (r210) If video or audio preset wasn`t found, instead of switching to "Copy", preset will be chosen by
           the following scheme: default preset for this format->a very first preset in the list (except
           "Disabled")->"Copy" (req. by Procrustean).
>>> (r209) Please let me know if changes in r209 broke opening of files, that previously worked without any
           problems (it may happen in case of non-English characters in path).
>>> (r209) Added a verification check for the input files: if file path contains characters, not supported
           by the current code page, an error message occur. This feature can be disabled in: Settings->
           Global settings->Check for illegal characters in pathes.
>>> (r209) SafeOpenDialog: the stdout encoding changed to UTF-8.
>>> (r208) For batch opening option "Clone from the already opened file to each other" doesn`t work if selected
           player engine is ScriptView or PictureView (rep. by newsky).
>>> (r207) In order to minimize negative effects of crashing XviD4PSP, the task list now will be automatically
           saved into backup file. If backup.tsks exists in Temp folder on application startup, then user will be
           asked about restoring previously saved tasks from this backup file. Since crashes not producing temporary
           files deleting, all saved tasks will be (probably) restored successfuly. This option can be disabled
           in settings: Settings->Global settings->Create a backup of the tasks list.
>>> (r207) Added experimental ability to save and restore tasks list, including the current (not queued yet)
           task, but excluding the tasks that are currently encoding. Tasks list context menu, option "Save
           tasks list". To restore tasks, you need to open previously saved *.tsks file. Note: the ordinal
           numbers of tasks will not be checked nor changed; due to deleting temp files on closing XviD4PSP,
           some tasks will be impossible to re-load later if they uses such files (extracted audio- or video-
           tracks, index-files etc). So, successful restoring of saved tasks is not guaranteed!
>>> (r206) FFRebuilder: reset Windows 7 taskbar progress state when starting a new task (rep. by Procrustean).
>>> (r205) Fixed a possible unhandled exception on closing DVD-Import window (rep. by Mihanja80).
>>> (r204) Fix for possible crash when switching a "Format" combobox and file with audio preset wasn`t found.
>>> (r204) Option "Encode audio first, then video" (Settings->Global settings->Encoding) now enabled
           by default; AAC defaults was changed.
>>> (r204) Some audio options still was common for tasks, based on one source file. Not fix but workaround,
           see also r124 (rep. by LonerD).
>>> (r203) Fix for project configurations (Release/Debug).
>>> (r202) Added support for Windows 7 taskbar progress indication. Enabled by default for Win7, can be disabled
           in "Settings->Global settings->Enable Windows 7 taskbar progress indication" (req. by Procrustean).
>>> (r201) Various changes in the x264 codec settings window. Some options was reallocated between tabs; few
           new options was added; added support for "--preset" key; added a key-sign "--extra": everything
           that placed after this key will remain unchanged when preset is recreated (for all passes will be
           used data from the last (final) pass).
>>> (r200) Version numeration changed (5.0.37.8 r200 -> 5.10.200.0, where 5 - series, 10 - version,
           200 - SVN revision, 0 - subrevision/test build).
>>> (r199) After opening a "Select video (audio, subtitles) file" dialog window and switching to another
           application, when we switching back to XviD4PSP this window will not be activated - fixed.
>>> (r198) Removed a hard-specified icon from the MainWindow.
>>> (r197) Into error messages added a StackTrace info (currently only for MainWindow).
>>> (r197) An unhandled exceptions catching.
>>> (r196) Avisynth plugin NNEDI2 was replaced by NNEDI3.
>>> (r195) A "Search" function added to "Help" window (help for XviD, x264, Changelog).
>>> (r195) In the XviD settings window added ability to choose encoder version (old 1.2.2 or recent 1.3.0);
           checkbox "Lumimasking" was replaced by combobox "HVS masking mode".
>>> (r194) Added ability to edit pathes for media players ("AviSynth->Play in"), just click on appropriate icon
           and select executable file.
>>> (r194) Better detection of location of Media Player Classic executable file (rep. by Procrustean).
>>> (r193) Final log from x264.exe sometimes may contain garbage (progress info) - fixed.
>>> (r192) Fixed demuxing of VP8 video (from WebM).
>>> (r192) tsMuxeR: better error handling; fixed muxing of AAC stored in M4A; MOV and MP4 file extensions added to
           the list of valid extensions for Direct Remuxing.
>>> (r192) FFmpeg produces broken H264 stream when extracting a raw video from some containers (MKV, MP4, MOV, FLV,..).
           As a workaround, extracting from such containers will be performed not to raw H264, but to MP4.
>>> (r192) GetDemuxer() always returns FFmpeg as demuxer for files with extension in uppercase (rep. by newsky).
>>> (r191) Resolution/Aspect window: fixed (?) "Input aspect" switcher.
>>> (r191) Custom format settings window: editing of parameters is now more user-friendly.
>>> (r190) FFRebuilder window was reworked. Added ability to edit command line, ability to store presets, Help tab.
>>> (r189) "Editing audio options" window: added error messages from the Demuxer (also more error messages from the
           Demuxer in the MainWindow); drag-and-drop support for external audio tracks.
>>> (r189) FFInfo.cs (a class for obtaining media information about the source file using FFmpeg.exe) was reworked.
>>> (r188) AviSynthScripting.cs: "adjustdelay=-3" moved to a better suitable place; UnalignedSplice (+) replaced
           with AlignedSplice (++).
>>> (r187) DirectShow player engine: AviSynth error messages will be shown with native AR.
>>> (r186) Selected "Final action" sometimes not performing.
>>> (r185) Video->Decoding: option "Use new FFmpegSource2" now turned on by default.
>>> (r185) For FFmpegSource2, if option "Enable Audio" is turned on, parameter "adjustdelay" will be set to "-3".
           It fixes next problems (may appears only if the source file has an audio track with non-zero Delay):
           1. "FFAudioSource: Out of bounds audio samples requested" error message - when audio encoding is mostly finished.
           2. "Access Violation" error mesage or crash - immediately after opening the source file.
           3. Twice-delayed audio track (delay in the FFAudioSource and function DelayAudio() in the script).
>>> (r185) Fixed removing of needless resizer ("mod2-protection") from the script (bug since r161).
>>> (r185) Changed order of writing into the script functions DelayAudio() and channels converter. Channels converter
           now will be added right after DelayAudio() (it was vise versa in the previous versions). It fixes a possible
           crash of AviSynth (if audio track has positive delay in conjunction with downmixing audio channels), that may
           happen on some AviSynth versions (rep. by AlexalForever).
>>> (r184) MediaInfoWrapper: some deprecated Parameters was replaced.
>>> (r183) More fixes for r180.
>>> (r182) Some changes for DGDecNV 2021, 2032 and 2034 (DGDecodeNV.dll instead of DGMultiDecodeNV.dll, hints=true for ColorMatrix).
>>> (r181) "IsValidVOBName" false positive detecting some VOB-files as part of the DVD. This, and changes in r164,
           results in some VOB-files can`t be opened (rep. by AkvenJan).
>>> (r180) Color correction window: changed default name for user`s presets from Manual to Custom.
>>> (r180) Video and audio encoding settings windows: fixed loading of wrong codec window after changing encoder preset
           from Copy to any other (using combobox Profile) and possible crash in video codec window.
>>> (r179) Some improvements for the NumericUpDown user control.
>>> (r178) Internal interlace analyzer instead of bautodeint.exe (based on http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=758642
           and MeGUI; with speed improvements).
>>> (r177) Added ability to disable audio in input files (Audio->Decoding->Enable audio in input files). If checkbox is
           unchecked, all video files will be opened without audio. This doesn`t affect audio files and AviSynth scripts.
>>> (r176) AvsP was added to AviSynth menu. If you already have opened file in XviD4PSP, AvsP will be started with current
           script. In other case you will be asked to save a new script (Untitled.avs), it will be opened in AvsP and
           after closing AvsP this script will be opened in XviD4PSP. If you press Cancel, AvsP will be started "as is".
>>> (r175) MKVExtractGUI-2 now will be used instead of MKVExtractGUI (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mkvextractgui-2/).
>>> (r175) MKVMerge: fixed muxing progress detection (it was broken for non-english languages). Header compression set to
           "none", it can be changed by modifying registry key MKVMerge_Compression: empty value - do not add --compression
           key to CLI, any other values - argument for --compression. MKVMerge_Charset - this key specify output charset for
           MKVMerge/MKVExtract/MKVInfo (info, error messages etc): empty value - do not add --output-charset key to CLI,
           Auto - specify system charset, any other values - argument for --output-charset (by default value=empty, but if
           MKVMerge/MKVExtract/MKVInfo uses wrong charset for output, you can try to set MKVMerge_Charset to Auto).
>>> (r174) Background for ListViewItem.
>>> (r173) Fixed reset position to beginning after AviSynth/script errors (DirectShow and MediaBridge player engines).
>>> (r173) Added ability to create Bookmarks for preview, right click on preview -> Add/Remove bookmark (req. by DAlek01).
>>> (r172) Various changes in WPF Video Player (WPF_VideoPlayer.exe), also source code added to SVN.
>>> (r171) Added another player engine: PictureView. In this mode preview shows a static picture of current frame; AviSynth
           is only loaded when preview is updating; better accuracy of frame counter.
>>> (r171) DVDImport window: fixed incorrect positioning of DirectShow preview, if system DPI not equal to 96; selected
           video renderer in Settings->Player engine->DirectShow output - now also used for DirectShow preview in this window.
>>> (r170) Fixed problems with copying text to clipboard.
>>> (r169) Added warning message, if Test script is used when audio/video track is in Copy mode.
>>> (r168) Added BlackmanResize.
>>> (r168) Some new deinterlacers has been added: QTGMC (Bob), YadifModEDI2 (Bob), TIVTC+TDeintEDI, TIVTC+YadifModEDI,
           TFM (field-matcher for videos with phase-shifted fields) and TDecimate 23-25 (for auto deleting duplicate frames).
>>> (r167) Fixed possible crash of DirectShow preview (if the script contains no video, or in some other cases).
>>> (r166) It is now possible to enter time position into "Set Start" & "Set End" fields (format is HH:MM:SS.ms), fixed possible crash.
>>> (r165) For option "Read parameters from the script when saving a new task" added fps detection, fixed possible crash.
>>> (r165) Output file size 0Mb instead of "Unknown", if format is Audio and encoding with VBR - fixed.
>>> (r164) Better friends-files searching ("Auto join" option) for vobs from one DVD (rep. by mihanja80).
>>> (r163) Fixed crash in AviSynthEncoder if creating encoder process (run a binary file) fails (rep. by Zag30).
>>> (r162) Better error handling for xvid_encraw.exe; encoding statistics from XviD now available in the encoding log.
>>> (r162) Next options has been added into XviD settings window: full1pass, threads, max_key_interval, bquant_ratio, bquant_offset,
           reaction, averaging, smoother, kboost, ostrength, oimprove, odegrade, chigh, clow, imin, imax, pmin, pmax, bmin, bmax,
           vbvmax, vbvsize, vbvpeak.
>>> (r161) From now, filtering part of the script (i.e. all text that placed between ###[FILTERING]### tags) will be untouched
           when script is re-created.
>>> (r160) If setting "Auto volume" = "Before encoding" and in queue few tasks based on one source-file, gain will
           be altered only for the first task - fixed.
>>> (r159) When XviD4PSP minimized or hidden, every new encoder window appears not in hidden-mode (rep. by brunorex).
>>> (r159) A new item "Disable balloons" added to TrayIcon menu (req. by brunorex).
>>> (r158) For Custom-format added ability to create THM-preview while encoding.
>>> (r157) Added ability to encode audio before encoding video. "Settings->Global settings->Encoding->Encode audio first,
           then video", disabled by default (video will be encoded first). This option may be very useful for "2-Pass size"
           and "3-Pass size" encodings with VBR audio, because when video encoding starts, exact size of the audio-file will
           be already known (by Procrustean).
>>> (r156) In Custom-format option Muxer=Disabled not worked properly, if video coder is XviD.
>>> (r153) Resolution/Aspect->Manual, after clearing SAR field, SAR receives wrong value ("" instead of null).
>>> (r152) For DirectShow player engine added ability to select video renderer (Settings->Player engine->DirectShow output).
>>> (r152) Fixed problem with preview (black borders and wrong AR) for anamorphic resolutions, if system video renderer uses
           option "Maintain Aspect Ratio" by default (rep. by AkvenJan).
>>> (r151) Custom format and formats settings window was reworked. Some options has been added:
           -mod for each side - as separate setting for this format.
           -Can be anamorphic - if it enabled, video will have anamorphic aspect when source-file is anamorphic (in
            global settings option "Maintain anamorphic aspect" must be enabled too). If it disabled, resolution
            will be recalculated to non-anamorphic.
           -Force format - muxers MP4Box and FFmpeg have special keys to override (force) output format. For FFmpeg
            you can set any format as you want (by editing ini-file).
           -Split output file - for muxers MKVMerge, MP4Box and tsMuxeR you can specify size of parts to split
            final file (you can set any size as you want by editing ini-file).
           -Don`t multiplex video and audio - do encode video and audio tracks, but don`t multiplex them in final file.
           -Use direct remuxing if possible - don`t demux tracks for Copy, instead use source-file and specify track
            that muxer must use from it, if possible.
>>> (r151) File extension wasn`t updated when changing Format (editing tasks in queue).
>>> (r150) Removed ConvertToYUY2() from the "preview"-script.
>>> (r149) FFmpeg as demuxer for MKV, if it contains VC-1 or WMV video.
>>> (r148) Fixed: bits/pixel calculation, prediction of output file size if Audio = Copy, audio-bitrate is unknown,
           but audio-file is already demuxed (rep. by NasaCNN).
>>> (r147) Fixed wrong duration and frames count if source file is RAW-AAC (*.aac).
>>> (r146) Added ability to preserve audio-delay in Copy mode (only for next muxers: MKVMerge, MP4Box, VirtualDubMod,
           FFmpeg, tsMuxeR). Due to some specific reasons this function may work improperly. Audio->Decoding->
           Apply Delay in Copy mode, disabled by default.
>>> (r146) Added a new method of audio-delay calculation. Most probably you need to use this method if video decoder is:
           FFmpegSource (1 or 2), DirectShowSource2, or DirectShowSource with "Enable Audio" is disabled. Audio->Decoding->
           Use new Delay calculation method, disabled by default.
>>> (r146) For DirectShowSource and FFmpegSource added option "Enable Audio", that allows this decoders to decode audio
           directly from the source file, w/o demuxing. If it`s disabled, audio will be extracted and decoded by regular
           audio-decoder.
>>> (r146) Option "Don`t demux audio for preview" has been removed.
>>> (r144) Out aspect 16:9 is now allowed for "AVI DV NTSC" and "AVI DV PAL" formats.
>>> (r144) Fixed a bug with incorrect resolution if SourceType = Decimating and Deinterlace = Disabled (bug since r117).
>>> (r143) Option "Don`t demux audio for preview" has been moved to the Audio-decoders settings window.
>>> (r143) Added: RawSource for y4m- and yuv-files; RaWavSource for wav-files, selected by default (req. by Procrustean).
>>> (r143) Added Film-percents analyser for DGIndex-files (Auto ForceFilm), enabled by default.
>>> (r143) Added settings window for audio- and video- decoders (Video->Decoding, Audio->Decoding).
>>> (r142) Fixed incorrect Temp path (http://forum.winnydows.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1433).
>>> (r141) "Save all scripts" added to tasks area context menu (req. by newsky).
>>> (r141) Save SAR to (and restore it from) the scripts - added (for anamorphic encoding).
>>> (r140) System tray icon now can be disabled (Settings->Global settings->Enable system tray icon).
>>> (r139) Some other fixes.
>>> (r139) Fixed fps detection with FFmpeg.
>>> (r139) Some caches remain in the Temp-folder if source file wasn`t opened successfully.
>>> (r139) Throw an Error if video decoder returns zero-size image.
>>> (r138) Added TrayIcon and added ability to minimize program to tray (req. by AkvenJan).
>>> (r137) Fixed blocking of folder with source file(s) ("drag-and-drop" opening).
>>> (r136) Added ability to reorder (move up/down) saved tasks (req. by mbamg).
>>> (r135) Some improvements for THM-creation and JPG-screenshots (by Procrustean).
>>> (r134) Resolution/Aspect window: added a new tab "Manual" (it allows user to specify all values manually).
>>> (r133) Added switcher to select preview mode (Preview/ScriptView). In the ScriptView-mode AviSynth is not loaded, as result
           very fast switching between filtering presets, formats, and in all other cases where preview must be loaded/updated;
           more capability with CUDA-decoders. This switcher available in the "Settings->Player engine" menu, and also in the
           player context menu (right-clik on the player area). (Idea by Procrustean).

Updated:   Package of plugins and filtering presets by Tempter57.
---
>>> (r132) Updated Spanish translation (by Tuko).
>>> (r131) x264.exe settings window: added Superfast preset (x264 r1510+); added --qpmax, --qpstep, --min-keyint, --keyint, --nal-hrd,
           --aud; some other changes.
>>> (r130) Added list of "Recent files".
>>> (r129) For the iPod 5.5G format with x264 encoding, a muxer was changed from the MP4Box(NicMP4Box) to ffmpeg (rep. by jhonny2).
>>> (r128) Updated Spanish translation (by Ginger).
>>> (r127) Added support for the DGMultiSource() decoder and dgi-files (DGIndexNV index files). The source file
           must be indexed by the DGIndexNV and project must be saved into separate folder (w/o any files in it).
           Then log-file must be placed in the same folder. If it wasn`t found, then all info will be recieved from
           the source-file via MediaInfo (but log file is more recommended).
           Some changes for the d2v and dga opening. For dga-files there is no need to put log-file in the same folder,
           but it`s still recommended.
>>> (r126) Audio gain detection is now fully internal, normalize.exe and temporal WAV-file is not needed anymore.
>>> (r125) Some fixes for FFV1 and HUFF encoders.
>>> (r124) Fixed problems with audio encoding for several tasks, when all this tasks is based on one source-file.
           Fixed problems with common audio encoding settings for all the tasks, if audio preset is Custom.
>>> (r123) In the x264 encoder window was updated internal presets, so now they fully equivalent to the same presets 
           from the x264.exe (Ultrafast, Veryfast, Faster, Fast, Medium, Slow, Slower, Veryslow, Placebo). B-pyramid mode
           is now Normal by default (x264 r1455+).
>>> (r122) In the AC3-encoder settings window added two new options: "Bandwidth" and "Dialog normalization level".
>>> (r121) Fixed issue with re-opening some DVDs (bug since r89).
>>> (r120) Removed option "Renew script when audio/video encoding settings is changed". For audio-settings the script will be auto 
           re-created if audio encoder was changed (but not their settings), for video-settings.. there is no any reasons to re-create
           script.
>>> (r119) Added new option "Don`t delete any caches and temp files" - for those who use XviD4PSP as script creator and then encoding
           it in another apps.
>>> (r118) Fixed some problems with audio-presets switcher (Disable mode on\off, switching between formats when source have no
           audio). Audio=Disabled now also can be used for Batch-opening (if "Clone audio options"- is on).
>>> (r117) Yadif is now default deinterlacer.
>>> (r117) "Smart" deinterlace for HYBRID_PROGRESSIVE_INTERLACED sources. If source type is HYBRID_PROGRESSIVE_INTERLACED, then 
           only frames with visible interlace will be deinterlaced. All other frames will be untouched. It works only for deinterlacers,
           that didn`t change framerate. On some specific videos (noisy etc) may produce bad results. Not intended for sources that
           must be IVTC`ed.
>>> (r116) Fixed UpdateOutFrames issues: trim and test-script wasn`t take into account; for deinterlacers that 
           change the number of frames, not occurred recount number of frames if AssumeFPS - is selected in settings
           "Framerate modifier".           
>>> (r116) For Batch-opening added new options: clone deinterlace, clone output framerate, clone audio options.
>>> (r115) Extension for demuxed vc1 streams was changed from VC1 to AVI (rep. by hikaru1022).
>>> (r114) If Audio encoding mode is VBR, then output file size must be "Unknown".
>>> (r112) Added FLAC encoder (from FFmpeg), it available for Audio and MKV formats.
>>> (r111) Added Estonian translation (Estonian.txt by tudiludi).
>>> (r110) In the x264 settings window for CRF mode label "Quantizer: (Q)" replaced by "Quality: (CRF)".
>>> (r110) In the AAC settings window added option -2passperiod (only for 2pass mode).
>>> (r108) Various changes in the Decoder, Demuxer, Encoder and AviSynthEncoder (error handling based on ExitCode and other).
>>> (r108) Added 2-pass ABR mode for AAC encoding. It require a temporal WAV-file, that will be created when encoding
           starts.
>>> (r107) For the AVI, MKV, MP4, MOV and Custom formats added ability to specify a valid divider for the picture sides
           (mod16, mod8, etc). Video->Resolution/Aspect->Settings.

Updated:   FFmpegSource2 (2.13 r257_test, http://code.google.com/p/ffmpegsource)
Updated:   MediaInfo (0.7.27, http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net)
Updated:   FFmpeg (unofficial build r21221, http://ffmpeg.org, http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/autobuilds)
Updated:   MKVtoolnix (3.0.0-build20100111-207, http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/win32/pre)
Updated:   neroAacEnc (1.5.1.0, http://www.nero.com/eng/downloads-nerodigital-nero-aac-codec.php)
---
>>> (r106) Fixed issue with loosing log from the x264.exe.
>>> (r105) Some fixes and changes in the Decoder.xaml.cs, Demuxer.xaml.cs, Caching.xaml.cs and MainWindow.xaml.cs.
           Opening files, demuxing streams..
>>> (r105) Option "Don`t demux audio for preview" now also work for FFmpegSource decoders. If it enabled, then files will
           be opened w/o audio demuxing, so audio will be decoded by FFmpegSource (but if it can`t decode, audio will be
           demuxed as usually). Remember that for many reasons it is not recommended to use this option!
>>> (r104) Added new option "Add AssumeFPS() to force FPS" for the FFmpegSource decoders (both). It must resolve problems
           with wrong fps sometimes received from this decoders, but it also can produce some new problems. This option is
           on by default and can be disabled in the Video->Decoding->FFmpegSource menu.
>>> (r103) Step for adjusting --qcomp now 0.01 (reg. by bugariarmando).

>>> (r101) NicMP4Box will be used if format = iPod 5.5G, video = x264 (or Copy) and NicMP4Box.exe exists here: \apps\MP4Box.
           This option already was implemented but can`t be used because 3-years old NicMP4Box didn`t know anything about
           the "-ipod" key, so there was error when muxing.
>>> (r100) Nothing special, simply rev. #100 :)

>>> (r98) Custom CLI added and for the XviD too.
>>> (r97) Fixed problem with reset Custom CLI after storing it as preset (rep. by NewmanOZ).
>>> (r96) ListView instead of TextBox (HotKeys settings), desired action now can be choosen directly from the list.
---
>>> (r95) Fixed direct encoding to MKV if video coder other than x264 (it can be direct only if x264 is used, bug since r92).
          Also added direct encoding to MP4 and FLV, if video=x264 and audio=Disabled.
>>> (r95) Fixed bug with AVI encoding using x264 and disabled audio (rep. by electricway, bug since r58).
>>> (r94) Added enhanced HotKeys support, every hotkey can be redefined by user in the "Global settings->HotKeys" menu. 
          Simply select "Action", then press "Edit", then enter desired combination on the keyboard, and then press "Save".
>>> (r93) Added support for 64-bit x264.exe (via avs4x264.exe). To use it, you must add x264_64.exe and avs4x264.exe into
          x264 folder, and turn on this option it settings (Global settings->Encoding).
>>> (r92) Some changes in the MediaPlayerClassic call (now player is checked in 4 possible folders).
>>> (r92) Direct encoding (w/o intermediate files) to MKV if format=MKV, encoder=x264 and audio=Disabled.
>>> (r91) Fixed autogain with negative values ("-" was not used), expanded the range of adjustment.
>>> (r91) Added ability to disable auto delay insertion for the output audio track (Audio->Processing options).
>>> (r90) Batch opening: added ability to make a pause after 1-st opened file (for setup encoding settings), added ability
          to clone Aspect/Resolution settings from the already opened file to each other (will be copied mostly all settings
          from this window), and same thing added for the Trim. Settings->Global settings->Batch encoding.
>>> (r89) Some fixes for MPEG-opening (cache-folder deletion) and Fullscreen (preview positioning). 
>>> (r88) VisualCrop: some settings have been added to the Resolution/Aspect window on the Settings tab.
>>> (r87) VisualCrop: fixed possibility of crash if some problems with recieving or processing the picture is exist.
>>> (r86) MediaInfo provides rounded values, so for better precision now by default AR info will be recieved from the FFmpeg
          (it can be disabled in the Resolution/Aspect window on the Settings tab).
---

>>> (r79) Now before new file will start opening, previsious opened file will be closed first.
>>> (r79) If "Close file" is pressed, now  this file will be checked, is it still used in one of the saved tasks. If it 
          still used, then audio and video caches will be added to the list of files, that will be deleted when program
          is closing. Otherwise they will be deleted immediately.
>>> (r78) Main window now can be moved by mouse dragging.
>>> (r78) Now after leaving FullScreen will be restored previsious window state (like it was before FullScreen).
>>> (r78) FullScreen now also available by double clicking on the preview area (like in any regular players).
>>> (r76) All video restrictions from the ValidateCopyAudio moved to the ValidateCopyVideo.

XviD4PSP 5.0.37.5(Unofficial)->5.0.37.6(Unofficial) r65 20.11.09 Changelog:


>>> Option "Always close encoding window when finished" has been moved to the global setting.

>>> Now in the file name of the saved log will be added full name of the encoding file (with extension).
    -requested by crazy-cactus

>>> Fixed non-alignment of the audio track in Copy mode when encoding to MKV, if audio-file was not demuxed before
    encoding start (this may happen if decoder is DirectShowSource). 
    -reported by wwmax

>>> Now when you select the menu item "Reset all settings" will appear a confirmation dialog, and after reset settings
    the program will be restarted.
    -requested by Embox

>>> Now when you save the picture (frame) in the save dialog by default will be added name of the source file and current
    frame number. Added ability to save pictures as BMP.
    -requested by Embox

>>> The MediaInfo window was reworked: added drag-n-drop; added Save button (for saving resulting log into file); added 
    info-switcher (MediaInfo, MediaInfoFull, FFmpeg, MP4Box, mkvinfo) - now you can change source of the info, without
    closing the window.

>>> Option "Auto delete DGIndex cache" now works. Deletion will occurs when you close the file (if it`s not used in any 
    job) or when main window is closing. This option is disabled by default.
     -reported by Embox

>>> Added new option "Create DGIndex-cache in the temp folder". If you will use this option, you must avoid opening mpeg
    files with identical names, because for this files name of the folder for the cache will be the same. This option
    is disabled by default (cache file will be created in the same folder as the source file).

>>> For the FLV format was changed restrictions on the parameters of the audio file in the Copy-mode, added possibility
    to create FLV with x264-video and AAC-audio.

>>> For the muxers mkvmerge, ffmpeg and mp4box now when an error occurs while muxing, in the encoding log will be added
    message, recieved from this muxers. Added displaying of the CLI-arguments for the demuxers. Also was fixed bug with
    audio encoding (when encoding didn`t start but no errors in the log).
  
>>> Some changes in the media closing, which should help with the problem of crashes\hangs in the DVD-import and main
    windows. 

>>> When encoding with preservation anamorph, now after auto-crop width and height will be recalculated on following
    algorithm: (original resolution - cropped) rounded to the nearest acceptable resolution. 

>>> In the Custom-format added new option for limit number of audio-channels by two (2ch - max).

>>> Fixed crash when user change video decoder, but opened file - is audio. Also fixed possible crash, if the new 
    decoder is unable to open the current video file.
    -reported by Embox

>>> Enhanced batch opening files. Now, in addition to "Open Folder", in the main window you can drop multiple files,
    and after that will appears dialog of selecting the folder where to save them. After this all files will be opened
    and added into the queue. Same thing will happen if you select multiple files by clicking on "Open..". For all
    files opened in this way still will be used filter by extensions. 
    -multiple-file selection in the Open menu provides by the modified version of SafeOpenDialog (modified by Stressman).

>>> Some changes for the preview player. For the DirectShow engine significantly improved the accuracy of the frame-counter.
    Also should disappear problem when some files start playing for a shirt time imediately after opening. Increased
    the speed of loading preview after refreshing. For the MediaBridge engine also slightly improved accuracy of the
    frame-counter, but it still not enough.

>>> For the preview player was changed the way of positioning when moving the slider. Now positioning will be performed
    only when you release the mouse button, but not always while you move slider (like was before). In results - more
    faster navigation through the video. Old algorithm also still available, it can be selected in the menu "Settings->
    Player engine->Old seeking", or by clicking right mouse button on the slider (these two settings interconnected and
    merged).

>>> Due to some problems when opening files with multiple audio tracks, needing to re-create Avisynt-script before start 
    encoding (with losing all data entered/changed by user), as well as for the reason that audio anyway will be
    extracted, option "Don`t demux audio for preview" now will be off by default.

>>> Fixed problem with (not)copying the AAC-tracks. For the RAW-AAC files now, as it should be, extension will be aac. 
    For mkvmerge added option --aac-is-sbr, it will be added when you copy-AAC audio (except DirectRemux) desired value 
    is based on information from the MediaInfo.

>>> Some menu items now will be inactive, untill you does not open the file.
    -requested by Embox

>>> Some cosmetic changes in the FFrebuilder window (by Embox), also added drag-n-drop function.

>>> Slightly changed radio-buttons in the menu (decoder, language selection etc) and menu style, also size of the tasks-area
    now will be stored in settings; some other changes.
    -by Embox

>>> DVD Import window now will receive some information about DVD from the MediaInfo, because using VStrip.dll produce crashes
    on some PCs when detecting video-parameters. Preview player now uses the volume stored in settings; added autoselection
    of the longest DVD-title.

>>> Fixed aspect adjusting method "Crop" - now crop calculating is sensitive to source video aspect; added aspect error
    re-calculation.

>>> Added ability to store current audiochannels converter method (it will be used provided it meets audiocoder and format
    restrictions).

>>> Size and location of the DirectShow-preview window now scaled (scaling based on the system DPI).

>>> Added ability to exit application even if encoding is running (encoding will be aborted).

>>> --b-pyramid --weightp, format PMP AVC working again.

>>> Added new function in the frame counter: go to (frame #). To activate it, click on counter, then enter number of
    requested frame, then press Enter (Escape - cancel). Right-click will insert current frame number.
    -requested by bugariarmando

XviD4PSP 5.0.37.4(Unofficial)->5.0.37.5(Unofficial) r25 Changelog:

sorry for my bad english :D    

>>> Added posibility to save encoding log to file. It will be created in Temp-folder or in current working folder - depen-
    nding on settings. Also if you made double-click on text in encoding window, current contents of this window also
    will be saved as log-file (on this time file will be created in the current working folder, no matter what you choose
    in settings). And if an error has occur while encoding, log-file will be saved automaticaly (in Temp-folder, as
    error.log).

>>> Added batch encoding function (File->Open folder...). First you must select folder in which you stored the source
    files, then you must select destination folder, in which encoded files will be placed (it can be the same folder).
    To avoid opening all files in the folder, filter was introduced, that select only files wich specified file-
    extensions. You can edit valid extensions in Settings->Global settings->Batch encoding menu, also here you can choose,
    do you want to programm start encoding your files immediately after opening they all, or no. In case if destination
    file name is exist in selected folder, file name will be changed - full file name (with extension) of the source file
    will be added at the begining of the destination file name. After opening all files in the folder, you will see
    statistics window, and for the latest opened file will be loaded preview. If you want to open one more folder, you 
    can do it now. Known issues:
    --in the process of opening one of the file may occur an error, and programm may hang up or something else..
    --in the process of opening one of the file, a programm window may appear (for selecting audio track, or something).
    --after opening audio-file programm change encoding format to Audio, and all other files will be opened with this
      format. To avoid this you must: delete (or replace) all audio-files from your folder, or (better way) edit valid
      file-extensions in the Settings->Global settings->Batch encoding menu.
    --you can`t pre-specified some parameters for the encoding file, such as resolution, etc. You can only: select filt-
      ration, colorcorrection, video and audio codec settings, and encoding format (but you need to open one file first,
      to some of this settings became available). Also you can use auto-options, that working after opening file (auto-
      volume, auto-crop, auto-deinterlace).
    --may be the new Custom format will help with previous issue, if you will be able to configure it as you need :)

>>> Instead of old plugin nnedi.dll now will be used new nnedi2.dll (it`s used in YadifModEDI, MCBob and NNEDI deinterlace
    filters).

>>> Added test of the Temp folder, to check is there are some files in it, or it`s empty. This check will be run after
    you selecting a new Temp-folder in Settings, or when programm find another disc with more free-space, and you hit Yes.
    If Temp-folder is not empty, an error window will appear, that will propose to go into the folder to delete files, or
    ignore this message. But it`s strongly recommended that you delete all not needed files, especialy if they starts
    with 4 digits (like 0358.h264 or 1254.mp3). Also in Settings->Global settings->Temp files was added Open button
    (to open selected Temp-folder).

>>> Now from the filtering preset to current script will be replaced and empty lines too (that contains nothing; they are
    deleting before) - it must enhances readability of the script.
  
>>> Added --subme10, --no-mbtree, --rc-lookahead and --no-psy options (in the x264 settings window), encoding presets 
    also was updated (by Procrustean).

>>> Added very experimental Custom format. All settings for this format stored in the FormatSettings.ini file, and 
    you can change it manualy, or use for this purpose specially designed new window - Edit format. Maybe in the future
    some other formats also will be transferred from the programm to this ini-file.

>>> Little fix for the new MediaInfo: if it says that video have PullDown, and if it have 23.976fps, then in programm retu-
    rnes value 29.970 fps. This fix was needed because MPEG2Source, using PullDown flag, will play this video at the
    29.970 fps. In other way, w/o this fix XviD5PSP will thinking that video is realy have 23fps, and did`t start process
    of deinterlace-analysing. But after this fix Xvid4PSP will start this process, and then turn on TIVTC for this video.

>>> In Video->Decoding->MPEG files menu was added new item: ForceFilm for MPEG2Source (for DGIndex). If you enable this
    option, and if MediaInfo says that current video is PullDowned + have 23fps, then DGIndex will indexing current file
    with option ForcedFilm (read DGIndex manual before use it!). In other case this option will be ignored.

>>> In the Tools menu item WPF Video Player was replaced by Open XviD4PSP folder. It will open folder, where XviD4PSP is
    located (may help, if you want to edit or change some files by yourself).

>>> Now in the encoding log you will see all info, that x264 produce when encoding. All lines from this log have filtering
    before, and in some cases this results in loosing some log-info (some error messages didn`t showing).  

>>> Fixed number of audio-channels detection using ffmpeg.exe. It was broken due to some changes in ffmpeg info-log.

>>> In "forbidden to copy" was added files with extensions: .avs, .d2v(only for video stream) and .dga(only for video st-
    ream).

>>> Fixed crashing when you trying to open audio-encoding settings window but audio mode is Disabled.
    --Reported by Makkay

Seems that 5.036 was last official version of the XviD4PSP. Winnydows (developer of the XviD4PSP) says many times that project 
XviD4PSP was stopped, and instead of this program he making new one - Winnydows Commander (with also contains Multi-encoder 
feature). This version of XviD4PSP I made only for myself. It means that all changes that I made were necessary for me, for me
and only for me. But if this changes will also necessary for you - I will be very glad :)
I`m not a programmer, so please forgive me all new bugs! :D You will use this version at your own risk!!!
