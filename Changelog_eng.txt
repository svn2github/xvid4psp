>>> (r106) Fixed issue with loosing log from the x264.exe.
>>> (r105) Some fixes and changes in the Decoder.xaml.cs, Demuxer.xaml.cs, Caching.xaml.cs and MainWindow.xaml.cs.
           Opening files, demuxing streams..
>>> (r105) Option "Don`t demux audio for preview" now also work for FFmpegSource decoders. If it enabled, then files will
           be opened w/o audio demuxing, so audio will be decoded by FFmpegSource (but if it can`t decode, audio will be
           demuxed as usually). Remember that for many reasons it is not recommended to use this option!
>>> (r104) Added new option "Add AssumeFPS() to force FPS" for the FFmpegSource decoders (both). It must resolve problems
           with wrong fps sometimes received from this decoders, but it also can produce some new problems. This option is
           on by default and can be disabled in the Video->Decoding->FFmpegSource menu.

>>> (r101) NicMP4Box will be used if format = iPod 5.5G, video = x264 (or Copy) and NicMP4Box.exe exists here: \apps\MP4Box.
           This option already was implemented but can`t be used because 3-years old NicMP4Box didn`t know anything about
           the "-ipod" key, so there was error when muxing.
>>> (r100) Nothing special, simply rev. #100 :)

---
>>> (r95) Fixed direct encoding to MKV if video coder other than x264 (it can be direct only if x264 is used, bug since r92).
          Also added direct encoding to MP4 and FLV, if video=x264 and audio=Disabled.
>>> (r95) Fixed bug with AVI encoding using x264 and disabled audio (rep. by electricway, bug since r58).
>>> (r94) Added enhanced HotKeys support, every hotkey can be redefined by user in the "Global settings->HotKeys" menu. 
          Simply select "Action", then press "Edit", then enter desired combination on the keyboard, and then press "Save".

>>> (r92) Direct encoding (w/o intermediate files) to MKV if format=MKV, encoder=x264 and audio=Disabled.
>>> (r91) Fixed autogain with negative values ("-" was not used), expanded the range of adjustment.
>>> (r91) Added ability to disable auto delay insertion for the output audio track (Audio->Processing options).
>>> (r90) Batch opening: added ability to make a pause after 1-st opened file (for setup encoding settings), added ability
          to clone Aspect/Resolution settings from the already opened file to each other (will be copied mostly all settings
          from this window), and same thing added for the Trim. Settings->Global settings->Batch encoding.
>>> (r89) Some fixes for MPEG-opening (cache-folder deletion) and Fullscreen (preview positioning). 
>>> (r88) VisualCrop: some settings have been added to the Resolution/Aspect window on the Settings tab.
>>> (r87) VisualCrop: fixed possibility of crash if some problems with recieving or processing the picture is exist.

>>> (r79) If "Close file" is pressed, now  this file will be checked, is it still used in one of the saved tasks. If it 
          still used, then audio and video caches will be added to the list of files, that will be deleted when program
          is closing. Otherwise they will be deleted immediately.
>>> (r78) Main window now can be moved by mouse dragging.

XviD4PSP 5.0.37.5(Unofficial)->5.0.37.6(Unofficial) r65 20.11.09 Changelog:


>>> Option "Always close encoding window when finished" has been moved to the global setting.

>>> Now in the file name of the saved log will be added full name of the encoding file (with extension).
    -requested by crazy-cactus

>>> Fixed non-alignment of the audio track in Copy mode when encoding to MKV, if audio-file was not demuxed before
    encoding start (this may happen if decoder is DirectShowSource). 
    -reported by wwmax

>>> Now when you select the menu item "Reset all settings" will appear a confirmation dialog, and after reset settings
    the program will be restarted.
    -requested by Embox

>>> Now when you save the picture (frame) in the save dialog by default will be added name of the source file and current
    frame number. Added ability to save pictures as BMP.
    -requested by Embox

>>> The MediaInfo window was reworked: added drag-n-drop; added Save button (for saving resulting log into file); added 
    info-switcher (MediaInfo, MediaInfoFull, FFmpeg, MP4Box, mkvinfo) - now you can change source of the info, without
    closing the window.

>>> Option "Auto delete DGIndex cache" now works. Deletion will occurs when you close the file (if it`s not used in any 
    job) or when main window is closing. This option is disabled by default.
     -reported by Embox

>>> Added new option "Create DGIndex-cache in the temp folder". If you will use this option, you must avoid opening mpeg
    files with identical names, because for this files name of the folder for the cache will be the same. This option
    is disabled by default (cache file will be created in the same folder as the source file).

>>> For the FLV format was changed restrictions on the parameters of the audio file in the Copy-mode, added possibility
    to create FLV with x264-video and AAC-audio.

>>> For the muxers mkvmerge, ffmpeg and mp4box now when an error occurs while muxing, in the encoding log will be added
    message, recieved from this muxers. Added displaying of the CLI-arguments for the demuxers. Also was fixed bug with
    audio encoding (when encoding didn`t start but no errors in the log).
  
>>> Some changes in the media closing, which should help with the problem of crashes\hangs in the DVD-import and main
    windows. 

>>> When encoding with preservation anamorph, now after auto-crop width and height will be recalculated on following
    algorithm: (original resolution - cropped) rounded to the nearest acceptable resolution. 

>>> In the Custom-format added new option for limit number of audio-channels by two (2ch - max).

>>> Fixed crash when user change video decoder, but opened file - is audio. Also fixed possible crash, if the new 
    decoder is unable to open the current video file.
    -reported by Embox

>>> Enhanced batch opening files. Now, in addition to "Open Folder", in the main window you can drop multiple files,
    and after that will appears dialog of selecting the folder where to save them. After this all files will be opened
    and added into the queue. Same thing will happen if you select multiple files by clicking on "Open..". For all
    files opened in this way still will be used filter by extensions. 
    -multiple-file selection in the Open menu provides by the modified version of SafeOpenDialog (modified by Stressman).

>>> Some changes for the preview player. For the DirectShow engine significantly improved the accuracy of the frame-counter.
    Also should disappear problem when some files start playing for a shirt time imediately after opening. Increased
    the speed of loading preview after refreshing. For the MediaBridge engine also slightly improved accuracy of the
    frame-counter, but it still not enough.

>>> For the preview player was changed the way of positioning when moving the slider. Now positioning will be performed
    only when you release the mouse button, but not always while you move slider (like was before). In results - more
    faster navigation through the video. Old algorithm also still available, it can be selected in the menu "Settings->
    Player engine->Old seeking", or by clicking right mouse button on the slider (these two settings interconnected and
    merged).

>>> Due to some problems when opening files with multiple audio tracks, needing to re-create Avisynt-script before start 
    encoding (with losing all data entered/changed by user), as well as for the reason that audio anyway will be
    extracted, option "Don`t demux audio for preview" now will be off by default.

>>> Fixed problem with (not)copying the AAC-tracks. For the RAW-AAC files now, as it should be, extension will be aac. 
    For mkvmerge added option --aac-is-sbr, it will be added when you copy-AAC audio (except DirectRemux) desired value 
    is based on information from the MediaInfo.

>>> Some menu items now will be inactive, untill you does not open the file.
    -requested by Embox

>>> Some cosmetic changes in the FFrebuilder window (by Embox), also added drag-n-drop function.

>>> Slightly changed radio-buttons in the menu (decoder, language selection etc) and menu style, also size of the tasks-area
    now will be stored in settings; some other changes.
    -by Embox

>>> DVD Import window now will receive some information about DVD from the MediaInfo, because using VStrip.dll produce crashes
    on some PCs when detecting video-parameters. Preview player now uses the volume stored in settings; added autoselection
    of the longest DVD-title.

>>> Fixed aspect adjusting method "Crop" - now crop calculating is sensitive to source video aspect; added aspect error
    re-calculation.

>>> Added ability to store current audiochannels converter method (it will be used provided it meets audiocoder and format
    restrictions).

>>> Size and location of the DirectShow-preview window now scaled (scaling based on the system DPI).

>>> Added ability to exit application even if encoding is running (encoding will be aborted).

>>> --b-pyramid --weightp, format PMP AVC working again.

>>> Added new function in the frame counter: go to (frame #). To activate it, click on counter, then enter number of
    requested frame, then press Enter (Escape - cancel). Right-click will insert current frame number.

XviD4PSP 5.0.37.4(Unofficial)->5.0.37.5(Unofficial) r25 Changelog:

sorry for my bad english :D    

>>> Added posibility to save encoding log to file. It will be created in Temp-folder or in current working folder - depen-
    nding on settings. Also if you made double-click on text in encoding window, current contents of this window also
    will be saved as log-file (on this time file will be created in the current working folder, no matter what you choose
    in settings). And if an error has occur while encoding, log-file will be saved automaticaly (in Temp-folder, as
    error.log).

>>> Added batch encoding function (File->Open folder...). First you must select folder in which you stored the source
    files, then you must select destination folder, in which encoded files will be placed (it can be the same folder).
    To avoid opening all files in the folder, filter was introduced, that select only files wich specified file-
    extensions. You can edit valid extensions in Settings->Global settings->Batch encoding menu, also here you can choose,
    do you want to programm start encoding your files immediately after opening they all, or no. In case if destination
    file name is exist in selected folder, file name will be changed - full file name (with extension) of the source file
    will be added at the begining of the destination file name. After opening all files in the folder, you will see
    statistics window, and for the latest opened file will be loaded preview. If you want to open one more folder, you 
    can do it now. Known issues:
    --in the process of opening one of the file may occur an error, and programm may hang up or something else..
    --in the process of opening one of the file, a programm window may appear (for selecting audio track, or something).
    --after opening audio-file programm change encoding format to Audio, and all other files will be opened with this
      format. To avoid this you must: delete (or replace) all audio-files from your folder, or (better way) edit valid
      file-extensions in the Settings->Global settings->Batch encoding menu.
    --you can`t pre-specified some parameters for the encoding file, such as resolution, etc. You can only: select filt-
      ration, colorcorrection, video and audio codec settings, and encoding format (but you need to open one file first,
      to some of this settings became available). Also you can use auto-options, that working after opening file (auto-
      volume, auto-crop, auto-deinterlace).
    --may be the new Custom format will help with previous issue, if you will be able to configure it as you need :)

>>> Instead of old plugin nnedi.dll now will be used new nnedi2.dll (it`s used in YadifModEDI, MCBob and NNEDI deinterlace
    filters).

>>> Added test of the Temp folder, to check is there are some files in it, or it`s empty. This check will be run after
    you selecting a new Temp-folder in Settings, or when programm find another disc with more free-space, and you hit Yes.
    If Temp-folder is not empty, an error window will appear, that will propose to go into the folder to delete files, or
    ignore this message. But it`s strongly recommended that you delete all not needed files, especialy if they starts
    with 4 digits (like 0358.h264 or 1254.mp3). Also in Settings->Global settings->Temp files was added Open button
    (to open selected Temp-folder).

>>> Now from the filtering preset to current script will be replaced and empty lines too (that contains nothing; they are
    deleting before) - it must enhances readability of the script.
  
>>> Added --subme10, --no-mbtree, --rc-lookahead and --no-psy options (in the x264 settings window), encoding presets 
    also was updated (by Procrustean).

>>> Added very experimental Custom format. All settings for this format stored in the FormatSettings.ini file, and 
    you can change it manualy, or use for this purpose specially designed new window - Edit format. Maybe in the future
    some other formats also will be transferred from the programm to this ini-file.

>>> Little fix for the new MediaInfo: if it says that video have PullDown, and if it have 23.976fps, then in programm retu-
    rnes value 29.970 fps. This fix was needed because MPEG2Source, using PullDown flag, will play this video at the
    29.970 fps. In other way, w/o this fix XviD5PSP will thinking that video is realy have 23fps, and did`t start process
    of deinterlace-analysing. But after this fix Xvid4PSP will start this process, and then turn on TIVTC for this video.

>>> In Video->Decoding->MPEG files menu was added new item: ForceFilm for MPEG2Source (for DGIndex). If you enable this
    option, and if MediaInfo says that current video is PullDowned + have 23fps, then DGIndex will indexing current file
    with option ForcedFilm (read DGIndex manual before use it!). In other case this option will be ignored.

>>> In the Tools menu item WPF Video Player was replaced by Open XviD4PSP folder. It will open folder, where XviD4PSP is
    located (may help, if you want to edit or change some files by yourself).

>>> Now in the encoding log you will see all info, that x264 produce when encoding. All lines from this log have filtering
    before, and in some cases this results in loosing some log-info (some error messages didn`t showing).  

>>> Fixed number of audio-channels detection using ffmpeg.exe. It was broken due to some changes in ffmpeg info-log.

>>> In "forbidden to copy" was added files with extensions: .avs, .d2v(only for video stream) and .dga(only for video st-
    ream).

>>> Fixed crashing when you trying to open audio-encoding settings window but audio mode is Disabled.
    --Reported by Makkay

>>> For the FLV format added posibility to muxing video, encdoded with On2 VP6 (FV4) codec.

>>> Fixed wrong decoder selection for .ts and .m2ts files with h264, there was always selected DirectShowSource for this
    files. Now decoder will be choosen according to settings for Other Files (if .ts or .m2ts contains h264), or for MPEG
    files (if .ts or .m2ts contains MPEG).

>>> Fixed wrong interpretation of fps value, recieved from the x264 while encoding, that may appear on some machines. 
    --Reported by carbonize.

>>> Some other changes..

    can specify which one will be used in Video->Decoding->FFmpegSource menu. By default will be used old version.

>>> Added one more decoder (source) for the video: DirectShowSource2 (DSS2) from Haali. DSS2 can provide frame accurate
    seeking, standart DirectShowSource can`t provide this. Also this decoder not using your sytem-codecs for decoding
    Audio (will be used internal plugins, that cames with XviD4PSP). You can choose this decoder in menu Video->Decoding..
    --thanks to Procrustean for the info about DSS2.
  
>>> Yamb, MKVextractGUI and AVI-Mux was added it the Tools menu.
   
>>> Fixed auto adding (not adding) audio files from the folder where *.dga project is located, if file names have 
    track_N string, (tsRemuxer add this info when demuxing file).
    --reported by Procrustean.

>>> x264 settings window have been reworked. Few new options was added, some elements was relocated. Also many changes
    for the new x264 (r1177+) was made. Rewritten tooltips, changed fast codec-presets (Main->Presets) and presets, that
    storing in .txt-files (but only for this formats: AVI, MP4, MKV, M2TS, MP4 PS3 or XBOX360, MP4 PSP AVC, TS) 
    --All presets, tooltips, testing and some code changes - by Procrustean. Testing, some good ideas and comments -

Seems that 5.036 was last official version of the XviD4PSP. Winnydows (developer of the XviD4PSP) says many times that project 
XviD4PSP was stopped, and instead of this program he making new one - Winnydows Commander (with also contains Multi-encoder 
feature). This version of XviD4PSP I made only for myself. It means that all changes that I made were necessary for me, for me
and only for me. But if this changes will also necessary for you - I will be very glad :)
I`m not a programmer, so please forgive me all new bugs! :D You will use this version at your own risk!!!
